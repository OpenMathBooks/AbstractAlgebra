<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">At this point, it might seem like we are running around in circles, as it often seems whenever we get close to the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem.  Before moving on, let's try to sort out the different things the theorems and propositions are doing in this section.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">First, if we are start with a given polynomial \(p(x)\) over some field \(F\text{,}\) we know there is some extension field \(E\) above \(F\) in which \(p(x)\) has a root \(\alpha\) (and therefore factors).  This is <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory.html" title="Theorem 8.10">Theorem 8.10</a>.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">On the other hand, we can start a extension field \(E\) of a base field \(F\) that contains some element \(\alpha\) <em class="emphasis">algebraic</em> over \(F\text{.}\)  By definition, \(\alpha\) is the root to some polynomial with coefficients from \(F\text{,}\) and by <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_minimum-poly.html" title="Theorem 8.15">Theorem 8.15</a> there is a minimum polynomial \(p(x)\) for \(\alpha\text{.}\)  By <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/proposition-minimal-poly.html" title="Proposition 8.17">Proposition 8.17</a>, the field extension \(F(\alpha)\) (which is a subfield of \(E\text{,}\) if not \(E\) exactly) is isomorphic to the quotient ring \(F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\text{.}\)</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">So if you have a minimal polynomial \(p(x)\text{,}\) you can find an extension field that contains a root \(\alpha\text{,}\) namely \(F[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle\text{.}\)  Or if you have an extension field with a root \(\alpha\text{,}\) you can find a minimal polynomial \(p(x)\) and the extension field that you would get by starting with \(p(x)\) will be precisely the smallest field containing \(F\) and \(\alpha\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="fields-subsection-algebraic-elements.html#Gjz">in-context</a></span>
