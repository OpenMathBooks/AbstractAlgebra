<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We claim that \([\Q(c):\Q]\) is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial for \(c\) (so the degree of the extension is the degree of the polynomial).  In fact, we know that \(\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}\) will always be a basis (where \(n\) is the degree).</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Why is this?  We know that \(\Q(c)\) must contain all powers of \(c\text{.}\)  However, \(c^m\) for \(m\ge n\) can always be expressed as a linear combination of \(c^i\) for \(i \lt n\text{,}\) using the minimal polynomial for \(c\text{.}\)  This proves that \(\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}\) spans \(\Q(c)\text{.}\)  To see why this set is linearly independent, note that if it were not, then there would be a linear combination of powers of \(c\) that was zero.  But that would give a polynomial equal to zero at \(c\text{,}\) making \(c\) a root of a polynomial of degree less than \(n\text{.}\)</p>
