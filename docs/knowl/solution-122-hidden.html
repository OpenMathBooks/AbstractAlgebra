<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Clearly this cannot be true, since we already said that these degrees were \(2\) and \(3\) respectively.  They key thing that made our argument work above was that the polynomial was a <em class="emphasis">minimal</em> polynomial.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">To further see that this is silly, what would the basis for \(\Q(\sqrt{7})\) be if it had size 7?  Would it be \(\{1, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{7}^2,\ldots, \sqrt{7}^4\}\text{?}\)  That is clearly linearly dependent, since \(\sqrt{7}^2\) is a multiple of 1.</p>
