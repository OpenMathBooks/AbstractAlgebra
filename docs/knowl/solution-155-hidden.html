<p>This is not always true.  For example, \(\Z_4 \not\cong \Z_2 \times \Z_2\text{.}\)  Similarly, \(\Z_12 \not\cong \Z_2 \times \Z_6\text{.}\)  In both of these cases, we know the groups are not isomorphic because \(Z_{mn}\) is cyclic, but the direct product is not.  What we need to have happen is that one of the elements of \(\Z_m\times \Z_n\) has order \(mn\text{,}\) and this will not happen if \(m\) and \(n\) have a common factor larger than 1.</p>
<p>It is not obvious that this condition is also sufficient.  It is, as we will soon prove.</p>
