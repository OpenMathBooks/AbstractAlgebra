\begin{introduction}{}%
The goal of this activity is to remind ourselves of basic but crucially important definitions we will need in our study of fields.%
\par
You are asked to provide definitions. Some definitions will include terms that also should be defined.  Make sure that you know what every word in a definition means (if not, provide definitions for those words).  For example, a \terminology{field} is a commutative division ring.  If you have not yet defined commutative ring and division ring, you should say what these mean.%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:aMX}%
Give a definition of a \terminology{ring}.%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:GUg}%
What is a \terminology{commutative ring with unity}?  How is this different from a ring?  (Note, ``unity'' is also sometimes called ``identity''.)%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:nbp}%
What is a \terminology{commutative division ring}?  What does ``division'' refer to here, and how is this different from a ring in general?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{4}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:Tiy}%
Give the definition of an \terminology{integral domain}.  How does this relate to the other types of structures you defined above?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{5}{}{}{p:exercise:zpH}%
What is an \terminology{ideal}?  What is the difference between an ideal and a \terminology{subring}?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\clearpage
\begin{divisionexercise}{6}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:fwQ}%
Consider the integers \(\Z\) (an integral doamin, right?).  What does the notation \(\langle 3 \rangle\) mean?  What sort of thing is this?  What is \(\langle r \rangle\) in general?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{7}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:LDZ}%
What is \(\Q[x]\)?  Then give an example of an ideal in \(\Q[x]\), using proper notation and by listing out some of the elements in the ideal.%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{8}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:rLi}%
Give the definition of a \terminology{quotient ring} (i.e. a \terminology{factor ring}).  What do elements of a quotient ring look like?  How are the operations defined?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{9}{}{0.23}{p:exercise:XSr}%
Illustrate you you wrote about quotient rings above using two examples: First, \(\Z/\langle 3 \rangle\), and then \(\Q[x]/\langle x^2 + 1\rangle\).  How many elements are in each of these quotient rings?  What do the elements look like?  Show how to add\slash{}multiply elements.%
