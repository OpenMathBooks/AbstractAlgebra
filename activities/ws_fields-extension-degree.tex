\begin{introduction}{}%
Recall that a \emph{basis} for a vector space is a linearly independent spanning set, and that the \emph{dimension} of a vector space is the size of a (any) basis for the space.%
\par
If \(K\) is an extension field of \(F\), we can view \(K\) as a vector space over the field of scalars \(F\).  In this case, we say the \terminology{degree} of \(K\) over \(F\), written \([K:F]\) is the dimension of this vector space.%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:uFB}%
Find a basis for \(\Q(\sqrt{7})\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\sqrt{7}):\Q]\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:Oys}%
Find a basis for \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5})\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}):\Q]\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:aMK}%
Suppose \(\alpha\) is a root of \(p(x) = x^5 -6x^4 + 9x^2 + 3\).  Find a basis for \(\Q(\alpha)\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\alpha):\Q]\).%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{4}{}{0.17}{p:exercise:GTT}%
What is the general rule here?  Some things to think about: If you claim that you can always find a basis in some systematic way, how do you know it is really a basis?  How do you know the basis is linearly independent?  How do you know it spans?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{5}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:nbc}%
The polynomial \(q(x) = x^5 -7x^3 - 5x^2 + 35\) has \(\sqrt{7}\) and \(\sqrt[3]{5}\) as roots.  Does this mean \([\Q(\sqrt{7}):\Q] = [\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}):\Q] = 5\)?  Why not?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\clearpage
We now have a fairly good idea how to work with \(\Q(\alpha)\).  What if we consider \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{7})\), the smallest field containing \(\Q\), \(\sqrt{7}\), and also \(\sqrt[3]{5}\)?%
\begin{divisionexercise}{6}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:ScS}%
We can think of this as an extension of an extension.  Take \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5})\) as our base field.  Adjoin to that \(\sqrt{7}\) to get \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{7})\). What is \([\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{7}):\Q(\sqrt[3]{5})]\)?  Use the general rule we discovered above and also find a basis%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{7}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:erk}%
Using the basis above and the basis for \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5})\) over \(\Q\), find a basis for \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{7})\) over \(\Q\).%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{8}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:Kyt}%
What is \([\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}, \sqrt{7}):\Q]\)?  What is the general rule for degrees of extensions of extensions?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{9}{}{0.15}{g:exercise:idm18303}%
What if we started with \(\Q(\sqrt{7})\) and then adjoined \(\sqrt[3]{5}\)?  Repeat the analysis you did above to make sure we get the same results about degree and basis.%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{10}{}{0}{p:exercise:qFC}%
What is \([\Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[4]{2}):\Q]\)?%
