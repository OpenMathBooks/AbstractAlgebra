\begin{introduction}{}%
Recall that a \emph{basis} for a vector space is a linearly independent spanning set, and that the \emph{dimension} of a vector space is the size of a (any) basis for the space.%
\par
If \(K\) is an extension field of \(F\), we can view \(K\) as a vector space over the field of scalars \(F\).  In this case, we say the \terminology{degree} of \(K\) over \(F\), written \([K:F]\) is the dimension of this vector space.%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:Oys}%
Find a basis for \(\Q(\sqrt[3]{5})\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\sqrt[3]{5}):\Q]\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:uFB}%
Find a basis for \(\Q(\sqrt{7})\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\sqrt{7}):\Q]\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:aMK}%
Suppose \(\alpha\) is a root of \(p(x) = x^5 -6x^4 + 9x^2 + 3\).  Find a basis for \(\Q(\alpha)\) over \(\Q\).  What is \([\Q(\alpha):\Q]\).%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{4}{}{0.17}{p:exercise:GTT}%
What is the connection between the degree of a field extension and polynomials?  Investigate this.  In particular, if you claim that you can always find a basis in some systematic way, how do you know it is really a basis?  How do you know the basis is linearly independent?  How do you know it spans?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{5}{}{0.07}{p:exercise:nbc}%
The polynomial \(q(x) = x^7-6 x^6-7 x^5+51 x^4-60 x^2-21\) has \(\alpha\) (from question 3) and \(\sqrt{7}\) as roots.  Does this mean \([\Q(\sqrt{7}):\Q] = [\Q(\alpha):\Q] = 7\)?  Why not?%
