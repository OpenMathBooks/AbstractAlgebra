\begin{introduction}{}%
Goal: Build the smallest field possible in which \(p(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 - x + 2\) is NOT irreducible.%
\par
Note that \(p(x)\) is irreducible over \(\Q\) because it has no roots in \(\Q\) (why is this and why is that enough?).  So let's invent a new number, call it \(\s\), and insist that \(\s\) is a root of \(p(x)\).  Then consider the smallest field \(E\) larger than \(\Q\) that also contains \(\s\).%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:hVK}%
List five elements in \(E\) that are NOT already in \(\Q\).%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:OcT}%
The element \(\s^3\) is in \(E\), but this can also be written using smaller powers of \(\s\).  How?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.1}{p:exercise:ukc}%
Describe \(E\) as a set using set builder notation.  In other words, \(E\) is the set of all elements of the form \textellipsis{}%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{4}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:arl}%
Wait: why are we doing this?  Our goal is for \(p(x)\) to factor.  Does it?  What would one of the factors be?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{5}{}{}{p:exercise:Gyu}%
Wait again: we want \(E\) to be a field.  Is it?  What would we need to check?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\clearpage
\begin{divisionexercise}{6}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:mFD}%
List five elements in the quotient ring \(\Q[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle\) (using the same \(p(x)\) from the previous page).  Remember, these will all be cosets.%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{7}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:SMM}%
The element \(x^3+\langle p(x) \rangle\) is an element of \(\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\), but it can also be written as a ``simpler'' coset.  How?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{8}{}{0.15}{p:exercise:yTV}%
Describe \(\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\) as a set using set builder notation.  In other words, this quotient ring is the set of all cosets of the form \textellipsis{}%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{9}{}{0.01}{p:exercise:fbe}%
Wait: if we want to show that \(E\) is a field, and \(E\) is basically the same as \(\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\), then we could just show \(\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle\) is a field.  What would this mean?  What do we need to verify?%
