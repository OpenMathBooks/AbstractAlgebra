\begin{introduction}{}%
Goal: Understand how elements of \(S_n\) can be represented as cycles and products of cycles.%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:MQw}%
Can every permutation in \(S_n\) be represented using cycle notation?  How could you represent the permutation \(\begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8 \amp 9 \\ 3 \amp 5 \amp 2 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 9 \amp 6 \amp 1 \amp 4  \end{pmatrix}\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:sXF}%
How should we define ``cycle''?  Write a definition.  Some considerations: is \((132)(45)\) a single cycle or two cycles?  Is \((3124)\) a cycle?  What should we call the \terminology{length} of a cycle?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:ZeO}%
Here are a few permutations of \(S_7\), written as products of cycles.  Are there other ways to write each of these using cycle notation?  What makes two products of cycles the \emph{same}?%
\begin{equation*}
(142)(2534)(46)(135) \qquad\quad (12546) \qquad\quad (16)(14)(15)(12) \qquad\quad (12)(37)(25)(37)(45)(46)
\end{equation*}
%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\clearpage
A \emph{transposition} (or \(2\)-cycle) is a cycle of \emph{length} 2.  That is, it swaps (transposes) a pair of elements.%
\begin{divisionexercise}{4}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:FlX}%
Can the cycle \((13254)\) be written as the product of transpositions?  Can it be written as the product of transpositions in more than one way?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{5}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:ltg}%
What about the product \((124)(2354)\)?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{6}{}{0.2}{p:exercise:RAp}%
Can you write \((13)(24)(45)(15)(26)(13)\) as the product of more than 6 transpositions?  Fewer than 6 transpositions?  Can you write it as the product of an odd number of transpositions?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{7}{}{0.01}{p:exercise:xHy}%
What numbers of transpositions can you write the identity \((1)\) as?%
\end{divisionexercise}%
