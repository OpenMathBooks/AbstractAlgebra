\begin{introduction}{}%
To prove that there is a degree 5 polynomial that is not solvable by radicals, we need to understand how \(S_5\) works.  Today will will prove that \(S_5\) is not a \emph{solvable} group.%
\par
To do this, we can show that \(A_5\) is simple, because then the only normal series we can get for \(S_5\) will be%
\begin{equation*}
S_5 \supset A_5 \supset \{(1)\}
\end{equation*}
but \(A_5\) is not abelian, so \(S_5\) is not solvable.%
\end{introduction}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{1}{}{0.25}{p:exercise:uyx}%
Show that \(A_5\) is generated by the set of 3-cycles.  You can do this by showing that every pair of transpositions can be written as a product of 3-cycles.%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{2}{}{0.25}{p:exercise:aFG}%
Show that if a normal subgroup \(N\) of \(A_5\) contains even one 3-cycle, then it is all of \(A_5\).  Remember, normal subgroups are closed under conjugates (here the conjugate would be \(aba\inv\) where \(a \in A_5\) and \(b \in N\)).%
\end{divisionexercise}%
\begin{divisionexercise}{3}{}{0.01}{p:exercise:GMP}%
Finally, show that every non-trivial normal subgroup of \(A_n\) contains a 3-cycle.%
