  <title>Isomorphisms</title>

    <p permid="qrX">
      Many groups may appear to be different at first glance,
      but can be shown to be the same by a simple renaming of the group elements.
      For example,
      <m>{\mathbb Z}_4</m> and the subgroup of the circle group
      <m>{\mathbb T}</m> generated by <m>i</m> can be shown to be the same by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of the two groups and between the group operations.
      In such a case we say that the groups are isomorphic.
    </p>
      <p permid="Wzg">
        Two groups <m>(G, \cdot)</m> and
        <m>(H, \circ)</m> are <term>isomorphic</term>
            <idx><h>Group</h><h>isomorphic</h></idx>
        if there exists a one-to-one and onto map
        <m>\phi : G \rightarrow H</m> such that the group operation is preserved;  that is,
        <me permid="svF">
          \phi( a \cdot b) = \phi( a) \circ \phi( b)
        </me>
        for all <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>G</m>.
        If <m>G</m> is isomorphic to <m>H</m>,
        we write <m>G \cong H</m>.

        <notation>
          <usage>G \cong H</usage>
          <description><m>G</m> is isomorphic to a group <m>H</m></description>
        </notation>

        The map <m>\phi</m> is called an <term>isomorphism</term>.

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-z4" permid="gha">
        <p permid="Qaa">
          To show that <m>{\mathbb Z}_4 \cong \langle i \rangle</m>,
          define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z}_4 \rightarrow \langle i \rangle</m> by <m>\phi(n) = i^n</m>.
          We must show that <m>\phi</m> is bijective and preserves the group operation.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto because
          <md permid="EJX">
            <mrow>\phi(0) &amp; = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\phi(1) &amp; = i</mrow>

            <mrow>\phi(3) &amp; = -i</mrow>
          </md>.
          Since
          <me permid="YCO">
            \phi(m + n) = i^{m+n} = i^m i^n = \phi(m) \phi( n)
          </me>,
          the group operation is preserved.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-real" permid="Moj">
        <p permid="whj">
          We can define an isomorphism <m>\phi</m> from the additive group of real numbers
          <m>( {\mathbb R}, + )</m> to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers 
          <m>( {\mathbb R^+}, \cdot )</m> with the exponential map; that is,
          <me permid="kRg">
            \phi( x + y) = e^{x + y} = e^x e^y = \phi( x ) \phi( y)
          </me>.
          Of course, we must still show that <m>\phi</m> is one-to-one and onto,
          but this can be determined using calculus.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-rational" permid="svs">
        <p permid="cos">
          The integers are isomorphic to the subgroup of
          <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> consisting of elements of the form <m>2^n</m>.
          Define a map <m>\phi: {\mathbb Z} \rightarrow {\mathbb Q}^\ast</m> by <m>\phi( n ) = 2^n</m>.
          Then
          <me permid="QYp">
            \phi( m + n ) = 2^{m + n} = 2^m 2^n = \phi( m ) \phi( n )
          </me>.
          By definition the map <m>\phi</m> is onto the subset
          <m>\{2^n :n \in {\mathbb Z} \}</m> of  <m>{\mathbb Q}^\ast</m>.
          To show that the map is injective,
          assume that <m>m \neq n</m>.
          If we can show that <m>\phi(m) \neq \phi(n)</m>, then we are done.
          Suppose that <m>m \gt n</m> and assume that <m>\phi(m) = \phi(n)</m>.
          Then <m>2^m = 2^n</m> or <m>2^{m - n} = 1</m>,
          which is impossible since <m>m - n \gt 0</m>.
        </p>
      </example>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-units" permid="YCB">
        <p permid="IvB">
          The groups <m>{\mathbb Z}_8</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}</m> cannot be isomorphic since they have different orders;
          however, it is true that <m>U(8) \cong U(12)</m>.
          We know that
          <md permid="xfy">
            <mrow>U(8) &amp; = \{1, 3, 5, 7 \}</mrow>
            <mrow>U(12) &amp; = \{1, 5, 7, 11 \}</mrow>
          </md>.
          An isomorphism <m>\phi : U(8) \rightarrow U(12)</m> is then given by
          <md permid="dmH">
            <mrow>1 &amp; \mapsto  1</mrow>
            <mrow>3 &amp; \mapsto  5</mrow>

            <mrow>7 &amp; \mapsto  11</mrow>
          </md>.
          The map <m>\phi</m> is not the only possible isomorphism between these two groups.
          We could define another isomorphism <m>\psi</m> by <m>\psi(1) = 1</m>,
          <m>\psi(3) = 11</m>, <m>\psi(5) = 5</m>, <m>\psi(7) = 7</m>.
          In fact, both of these groups are isomorphic to <m>{\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        </p>

      <example xml:id="example-isomorph-not-isomorph" permid="EJK">
        <p permid="oCK">
          Even though <m>S_3</m> and
          <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> possess the same number of elements,
          we would suspect that they are not isomorphic,
          because <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> is abelian and <m>S_3</m> is nonabelian.
          To demonstrate that this is indeed the case,
          suppose that <m>\phi : {\mathbb Z}_6 \rightarrow  S_3</m> is an isomorphism.
          Let <m>a , b \in S_3</m> be two elements such that <m>ab \neq ba</m>.
          Since <m>\phi</m> is an isomorphism,
          there exist elements <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> in <m>{\mathbb Z}_6</m> such that
          <me permid="JtQ">
            \phi( m ) = a \quad \text{and} \quad \phi( n ) = b
          </me>.
          However,
          <me permid="pAZ">
            ab = \phi(m ) \phi(n) = \phi(m + n) = \phi(n + m) = \phi(n ) \phi(m) = ba

          which contradicts the fact that <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> do not commute.
