        <p>
          The <term>Euler <m>\phi</m>-function</term> is the function that, on input <m>n</m>, gives the number of positive integers less than and relatively prime to <m>n</m>.  (That is, <m>\phi(n)</m> is the number of <m>m</m> with <m>1 \le m \lt n</m> and <m>\gcd(m,n) = 1</m>).  We also define <m>\phi(1) = 1</m>. Let's explore some properties of this function

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>p</m> is prime, what is <m>\phi(p)</m>?  Explain how you know.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Compute the following values of the function by brute force (list and count the numbers less than <m>n</m> relatively prime to <m>n</m>): <m>\phi(6)</m>, <m>\phi(10)</m>, <m>\phi(14)</m>, <m>\phi(15)</m>, and <m>\phi(21)</m>.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            All of the inputs in the previous task were the product of two primes.  Conjecture a formula for <m>\phi(pq)</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are distinct primes.
          </p>

      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          Does your formula also make sense for <m>\phi(p^2)</m>?  Does it work for <m>\phi(ab)</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are not primes?
