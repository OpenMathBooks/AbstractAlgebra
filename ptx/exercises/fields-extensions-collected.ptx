    <introduction>
      <p>
        The number <m>\phi = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}</m> (which happens to be the <em>Golden Ratio</em>) is not an element of <m>\Q</m>, but of course is an element of <m>\Q(\phi)</m>.  Let's explore that field a bit.

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find a polynomial with rational coefficients that has <m>\phi</m> as a root.  Call this polynomial <m>p(x)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Try setting <m>\phi = x</m> and do some algebra to get rid of any square roots.

      <statement>
        <p>
          What quotient ring is isomorphic to the field <m>\Q(\phi)</m>?  List two non-zero elements of that quotient ring and say which elements of <m>\Q(\phi)</m> they correspond to.

    <task>
      <p>
        Which coset does <m>\phi</m> itself correspond to?  Take this coset and plug it into <m>p(x)</m> to verify that the coset is a root of <m>p(x)</m> (show your work).
      </p>
    </task>
    <task>
      <p>
        The element <m>\phi^3</m> is an element of <m>\Q(\phi)</m> but can be expressed as <m>a+b\phi</m> for <m>a, b \in \Q</m>.  Find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.  Then find the corresponding element for both <m>\phi^3</m> and <m>a+b\phi</m> in the quotient ring and check that these two cosets are the same as each other.
