      <introduction>
        <p>
          Prove the following basic facts about orders of elements.  None of these are particularly difficult, so you should focus on writing nice, clean proofs.  In each of the following, <m>a</m> is an element of a group <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <p>
          If <m>\ord(a) = n</m>, then for any <m>r \lt n</m>, the inverse of <m>a^r</m> is <m>a^{n-r}</m>.  That is, <m>(a^r)\inv = a^{n-r}</m>.
        </p>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The order of <m>a\inv</m> is the same as the order of <m>a</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            Careful: it is not enough to say that <m>(a\inv)^n = e</m> (where <m>\ord(a) = n</m>).  That is only half of it, since you must also show that no smaller power of <m>a\inv</m> is the identity.
          </p>
        </hint>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            If <m>a^k = e</m> where <m>k</m> is odd, then the order of <m>a</m> is odd.
          </p>
        </statement>          
      </task>
      <task>
        <p>
          If <m>a \ne e</m> and <m>a^p = e</m> where <m>p</m> is prime, then <m>\ord(a) = p</m>.
        </p>
