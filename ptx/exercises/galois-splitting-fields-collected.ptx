  <introduction>
    <p permid="ouD">
      Consider the field <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)</m>.  Note this is the same field as <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, \sqrt[4]{3}i)</m>.
    </p>
  </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Is this a splitting field for some polynomial in <m>\Q[x]</m>?  If so, what is that polynomial, and what is its degree?
          </p>
        </statement>   
        <hint>
          <p>
            Guess a polynomial for one of these roots and then try to factor it completely over the complex numbers to see if that polynomial splits in the field.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the <m>[Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i):\Q]</m>?  Explain how you know.
          </p>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            It turns out that there are exactly 8 different fields between <m>\Q</m> and <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)</m>.  Find at least four of these (more if you can) and draw a large tower diagram showing how these are related (with degrees marked appropriately).
          </p>
        </statement>
        <hint>
          <p>
            The next part of this problem might be helpful (and you can assume it is true for this part).

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove that the fields <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3})</m> and <m>\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}i)</m> are isomorphic, but not equal. 
          </p>

    <statement>
      <p>
        Bonus: The field <m>\Q(\sqrt[3]{7}, \sqrt{2}i)</m> can also be written as <m>\Q(\gamma)</m> for a primitive element <m>\gamma</m>.  Find such a <m>\gamma</m> by working through the proof of <xref ref="theorem-primitive-element"/> with this example.  Explain how you found the number <m>a</m> from the theorem.
