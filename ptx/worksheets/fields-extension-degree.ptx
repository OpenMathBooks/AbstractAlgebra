          Recall that a <em>basis</em> for a vector space is a linearly independent spanning set, and that the <em>dimension</em> of a vector space is the size of a (any) basis for the space.

        <p permid="UXy">
          If <m>K</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>, we can view <m>K</m> as a vector space over the field of scalars <m>F</m>.  In this case, we say the <term>degree</term> of <m>K</m> over <m>F</m>, written <m>[K:F]</m> is the dimension of this vector space.

              What is the general rule here?  Some things to think about: If you claim that you can always find a basis in some systematic way, how do you know it is really a basis?  How do you know the basis is linearly independent?  How do you know it spans?

              We claim that <m>[\Q(c):\Q]</m> is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial for <m>c</m> (so the degree of the extension is the degree of the polynomial).  In fact, we know that <m>\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}</m> will always be a basis (where <m>n</m> is the degree).

However, <m>c^m</m> for <m>m\ge n</m> can always be expressed as a linear combination of <m>c^i</m> for <m>i \lt n</m>, using the minimal polynomial for <m>c</m>.  This proves that <m>\{1, c, c^2, \ldots, c^{n-1}\}</m> spans <m>\Q(c)</m>.  To see why this set is linearly independent, note that if it were not, then there would be a linear combination of powers of <m>c</m> that was zero.

              The point is that the tower rule is correct: you do multiply the degrees of each extension.  But these degrees are not always the degree of the minimal polynomials over the base field.  Each time you go up one floor in the tower, you must again ask what the minimum polynomial for the next element you adjoin is.
