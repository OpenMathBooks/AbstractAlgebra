        Main Question: What is the remainder when you divide <m>a^p</m> by <m>p</m>? 
        </p>

<exercise workspace="35%" permid="hth">
  <statement>
    <p permid="Skj">
      Compute <m>a^p</m> and its remainder when divided by <m>p</m>, for various values of <m>a</m> and <m>p</m>.  Everyone should do at least 5, and then share with the group.  As a group, discuss any patterns you see and form a conjecture.
    </p>
  </statement>
</exercise>

<p permid="WUc">
  Find the remainders when you perform the following divisions.  Try different values of <m>a</m>.  You should first guess what the value is based on your conjecture and then verify (or refute) your guess.

  Discuss in your groups: how might we think about the main question here in terms of group theory?  What would we need to prove (about groups)?
