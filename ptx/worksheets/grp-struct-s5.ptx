    <title>Activity: Working with <m>S_5</m></title>

    <introduction permid="vbn">
      <p>
        We are close to our goal of finding a degree 5 polynomial whose roots cannot be expressed in a nice way (using radicals and field operations).  It turns out that a key step in this goal is understanding the group <m>S_5</m>.  In this activity, we will get a better feel for this group by examining the <q>cycle structure</q> of its elements.
      </p>

    <exercise workspace="10%">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Every element in <m>S_5</m> can be written as a single cycle or a product of different cycles.  Write down all the different possibilities for how these cycles or products of cycles might look (focusing on their <q>shape</q> rather than the specific numbers in the cycles).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The identity looks like <m>(1)</m>.  Then there are all the 2-cycles, 3-cycles, 4-cycles, and 5-cycles.  There are also products of two 2-cycles, and products of 2-cycles and 3-cycles.

          Does <m>S_5</m> contain a non-trivial subgroup that contains all the transpositions (2-cycles)?  What is it, or why not?

      <solution permid="sgH">
        <p permid="JeS">
          No.  As soon as you have all the transpositions, you have all of <m>S_5</m>, since every element can be written as a product of transpositions.

           No, because as soon as you have this set, you can get every transposition.  To get <m>(ab)</m> you can multiply <m>(1a)(1b)(1a)</m>.

          Such a subgroup will have <m>(13524)</m>, <m>(14253)</m>, and <m>(15432)</m>, as these are the powers of <m>(12345)</m>
          Consider <m>(15432)(24)(12345) = (13)</m>. Can we get <m>(12)</m>?  Well, <m>(14253)(24)(12345) = (12)</m>.  We can get <m>(13524)(24)(14253) = (14)</m>.  Finally, we would show that we can also get <m>(15)</m>.  Then from the previous task, we get everything.

      Now let's consider the alternating group <m>A_5</m>.  Recall this is the group of all permutations in <m>S_5</m> that can be written as the product of an even number of 2-cycles.
