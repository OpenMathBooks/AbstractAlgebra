			<title>Monday: Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups</title>

			<p>
				The goal today is to understand how to classify all finite abelian groups.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Some abelian groups are cyclic. And if they are, we know exactly what they look like. They are isomorphic to <m>\mathbb Z_{n}</m> for some <m>n</m> (and this happens precisely when there is an element of order <m>n</m> in the group).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				But not all abelian groups are cyclic. In fact, even <m>\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2</m> is an example of this. So what does an abelian group look like in general?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Note that if a group is not cyclic, then it is not generated by a single element. But it will be generated by some number of elements. There are groups that are <em>finitely generated</em> and others that are not (require an infinite set of generators). Of course finite groups are finitely generated.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				If <m>g_1</m>, <m>g_2</m>, …<m>g_n</m> is a set of generators, that means that every element of the group can be written as a product of powers of these elements. If the group is abelian, then we can say each element <m>g \in G</m> is <m>g = g_1^{k_1}g_2^{k_2}\ldots g_n^{k_n}</m>. Some of the <m>k_i</m> might be negative or zero.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now the powers of <m>g_1</m> are exactly the elements of the cyclic subgroup <m>\langle g_1\rangle</m>, and similarly for all <m>g_i</m>. So this says that <m>G = \langle g_1\rangle\langle g_2\rangle\cdots\langle g_n\rangle</m>. So perhaps you would think that <m>G</m> could be written as an <em>internal</em> direct product of cyclic groups.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				To make sure that were true, we would also need <m>\langle a_i \rangle \cap \langle a_j\rangle = \{e\}</m> (the other requirement, that the subgroups are normal, we get for free since we are in an abelian group).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This will not always be true. In <m>\mathbb Z_{12}</m>, if we picked <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 6</m>, then we are done for.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So we must pick the generators carefully. We pick them based on what their orders are.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Given any abelian group <m>G</m>, let <m>G(p)</m> be the set of all elements whose orders are a power of <m>p</m>. For prime <m>p</m>, we call such groups <em><m>p</m>-groups</em>. Our first step is to break <m>G</m> down as the direct product of <m>p</m>-groups.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Specifically, say <m>|G| = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_n^{k_n}</m>. We can show that <m>G</m> is the internal direct product of <m>G(p_1)</m>, <m>G(p_2)</m>,…<m>G(p_n)</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						It is easy to verify that <m>G(p_i)</m> is really a subgroup. Thus we must only argue that <m>G(p_i)\cap G(p_j) = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m> and that <m>G = G(p_1)G(p_2)\cdots G(p_n)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The first is obvious, since the only power of one prime equal to a power of another prime is 1, the order of the identity.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
				The other must be true because we know that the product of these subgroups is at very least a subgroup of <m>G</m>, but it must have the same size, and therefore be equal to <m>G</m>.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So now we have the <m>G</m> is a direct product of <m>p</m>-groups. These <m>p</m>-groups might or might not be cyclic (consider the two examples we had on the activity from last time).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We need to understand the structure of <m>p</m>-groups. It would be nice to pick generators so that the <m>p</m>-group could be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups (all of which will also be <m>p</m>-groups).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Again, do so by considering the order of elements. Say we have a <m>p</m>-group <m>G_p</m>. Let <m>g</m> be any one of the elements in <m>G_p</m> of maximal order. So <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(g) = p^m</m> for some <m>m</m>. We will show that <m>G_p = \langle g \rangle \times H</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G_p</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This will be enough, because then we can proceed by induction to break down <m>H</m> (also a <m>p</m>-group, but of smaller order) similarly. Eventually we will be left with a second group that is cyclic (or trivial).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Here is the basic idea. The proof is by induction. We take <m>g</m> to be of largest order in <m>G_p</m>. Let <m>h</m> be of smallest order of all elements not in <m>\langle g\rangle</m>. Then shift to the quotient group <m>G/\langle h\rangle</m> and look at the element <m>\langle h\rangle g</m>. Argue that this has maximal order in <m>G/\langle h\rangle</m> and by induction conclude that <m>G/\langle h\rangle \cong \langle \langle h\rangle g\rangle \times H/\langle h\rangle</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>\langle h\rangle</m>. Then argue that this <m>H</m> makes <m>G_p \cong \langle g \rangle \times H</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The takeaway: The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups tells us that any finite abelian group <m>G</m> is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups, each of order a power of a prime. That is, <me>G \cong \mathbb Z_{p_1^{k_1}}\times \mathbb Z_{p_2^{k_2}}\times \cdots \times\mathbb Z_{p_n^{k_n}}</me> (the <m>p_i</m> need not be distinct).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				As an example, let’s classify all finite abelian groups of order <m>540 = 2^2 3^3 5</m>. One of these is <m>\mathbb Z_{2^2} \times \mathbb Z_{3^3} \times \mathbb Z_5</m>. Another is <m>\mathbb Z_{2}\times\mathbb Z_2\times\times \mathbb Z_{3^3} \times \mathbb Z_5</m>. Or we can break down the <m>3^3</m> in two different ways. All together there will be 6 groups with this order.

	<title>Friday: Application to Counting</title>
<p>
	Note: Wednesday was group project work day.
</p>
	<p>
			Let’s end the year with an example of how understanding group structure can help solve problems in other areas of mathematics. Consider questions of combinatorics. In Discrete you learned a variety of methods for quickly counting the number of outcomes (this is also useful in probability of course).
	</p>

	<p>
			How many ways are there for King Arthur and his 9 knights of the round table to sit around the round table? Why is the answer not just 10 factorial?
	</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
			One way to think about the above problem is to say that there are 10 seats, with 10 choices for who sits in the first, 9 choices for who sits in the second, and so on. But this is too many, since we just care who sits next to whom, not which chairs they sit in. So divide by 10 to account for the 10 different seating arrangements that should really count as one outcome.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			We have a similar way of correcting when we think of counting <em>combinations</em> instead of permutations.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			What about this problem: You want to put out place mats for Arthur and his knights. The mats come in two colors: blue and gold. How many ways can you arrange the place mats around the table?
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			This is harder. We could start by saying there are <m>2^{10}</m> arrangements (each spot has 2 choices). But how do we divide out by the duplicates?
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			The problem is that the number of duplicates depends on the number of each color. For example, we have only counted 1 outcome where all the mats are gold. But we have counted 10 with 1 blue and 9 gold, and they are all <q>the same</q>. We have counted 45 with 2 blue and 8 gold. How many of those should we have counted?
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			This is getting complicated fast. It seems like while this way of dividing up the outcomes could work, it is certainly no easy task.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			So here is an alternative suggestion. Instead of creating cases based on how many of each color we have, break up the set of distributions by the type of duplication.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			For example, we wanted to group together the 1 blue/9 gold placements because each could be achieved by rotating the table from another. So maybe lets group together all placements that are equivalent under this symmetry.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			The advantage: we understand symmetries fairly well: they give us a group structure. Here, the group of all rotations of a 10-gon, which is a subgroup of <m>D_{10}</m>.
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
			To make this precise, we will talk about the group <em>acting</em> on the set of outcomes (colorings). So let’s see what we can say about <q>group actions.</q>
				</p>
			</li>

		</ul>
