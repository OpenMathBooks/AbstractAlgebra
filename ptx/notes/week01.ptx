      <p>
        Today we introduce the course, including both logistics of how the course will run, and the content of the course through an activity about extension fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, some notes on the syllabus:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Textbook: a modified version of my Judson's abstract algebra book.  The book is free online (link in Canvas).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Quizzes, homework, exams, and project.  
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    There will be in-class quizzes (occasional) and online reading quizzes, through Canvas.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Daily homework (1-2 problems).  Expect to try them and resubmit for full credit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I encourage you to type homework using LaTeX or markdown.  See link to blog post.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The exams will have a take-home and in-class portion.  Announce tentative dates listed on syllabus.  The final is cummulative, but a take-home
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    There is a group project: 2-3 students per group.  We will work throughout the semester on it; you will present during the final exam meeting and submit a short paper on the topic.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Classroom policies: participation, attendance, makeups, don't be rude, don't cheat, disability resources, other resources.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Introduction to Field Theory</title>
    <p>
      The goal today is to work through a problem typical of what we will try to do this semester.  A lot of this should be review, but it is not easy review.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Work in groups on <xref ref="ws_fields-intro"/>.  
    </p>

    <p>
      For next class, read section 1.1.  Next time you will work together to remind each other what you learned last semester.
