<title>Wednesday: Powers mod powers</title>

<p>
  Start with the activity. That is, what is the remainder when you divide <m>a^p</m> by <m>p</m>?  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        This will depend on <m>a</m> and <m>p</m>.  But if <m>p</m> is prime, we should realize that <m>a^p \equiv p \pmod{p}</m>.  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Another way to say this is that <m>a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        What if <m>p</m> isn't prime?  Is there a power of all <m>a</m> which is equivruent to 1 mod <m>p</m>?  That is, for a given number <m>n</m>, will there be some <m>m</m> such that <m>a^m \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m> (no matter what <m>a</m> is)?  We will come back to this later. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Returning to the <m>p</m> prime case: Why might this be true?  Let's use group theory.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Which group should we look at if we are taking powers and working mod <m>p</m>?  Yup, <m>\Z_p^* = U(p)</m>.  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Asking what power of an element gives us 1 is asking for the <term>order</term> of the element.  That is, how many times do you need to <q>multiply</q> an element by itself to get the identity?
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In <m>U(7)</m>, find the order of each element.  Note that different elements might have different orders.  But what do you notice about all the orders? 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In any group <m>G</m>, for any <m>g \in G</m>, we know that the order of <m>g</m> is a divisor of the <em>order</em> of <m>G</m> (the number of elements in <m>G</m>).  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        This is a consequence of Lagrange's theorem.
        If you look at the powers of <m>g</m>, you will get the cyclic subgroup <m>\langle g \rangle</m>, which will have exactly as many elements as the order of <m>g</m>.  But Lagrange's theorem says that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of a group.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        So that means that whatever the order of <m>a</m> is in <m>U(p)</m>, it must divide the size of <m>U(p)</m>, which is <m>p-1</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        But further, if <m>a^t = e</m>, then <m>a^{kt} = e</m> as well.  So <m>a^{p-1} = 1</m> in <m>U(p)</m> (since <m>p-1</m> is a multiple of the order of each element).
      </p>
    </li>

  </ul>
</p>

  <title>Friday: More order and Euler's Theorem</title>
  <p>
    Last time we considered what powers of numbers are equivalent to 1 mod particular numbers.  We conjectured that if <m>p</m> is prime, then for any <m>a \lt p</m> we have <m>a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>.  This led to a discussion of the order of elements.  Here is a summary of what we have so far:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          For any finite group <m>G</m> and any element <m>g \in G</m>, we say the <term>order</term> of <m>g</m> is the least <m>k</m> such that <m>a^k = e</m> (the identity).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We also noted that if <m>\ord(g) = k</m> then <m>g, g^2, g^3,\ldots, g^k</m> are distinct elements.  Why is this?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>g^a = g^b</m> with <m>1 \le a \lt b \lt k</m>.  Then <m>g^{a-a} = g^{b-a}</m>, but <m>g^{a-a} = e</m>.  So that would mean that <m>g^{b-a} = e</m>.  This is impossible since <m>b-a</m> is less than <m>k</m>, and <m>k</m> was the least positive power of <m>g</m> that gives the identity.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Since there are <m>k</m> distinct powers of <m>g</m>, we have that the cyclic subgroup generated by <m>g</m>, that is, <m>\langle g \rangle</m> contains exactly <m>k</m> elements.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          That is, the order of the element <m>g</m> is equal to the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by <m>g</m>. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          But Lagrange's theorem tells us that the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Thus the order of any element <m>g \in G</m> must divide the order of <m>G</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's continue where we left off.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>\ord(g) = k</m>.  What is <m>g^{nk}</m> for any <m>n</m>?  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We have <m>g^{nk} = (g^k)^n = e^n = e</m>.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          That is, if <m>m</m> is a multiple of <m>\ord(g)</m>, then <m>g^m = e</m>.  Since the <m>|G|</m> is a multiple of <m>\ord(g)</m>, we have <m>g^{|G|} = e</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Is the converse true?  That is, if <m>g^m = e</m> does that mean that <m>m</m> is a multiple of <m>\ord(g)</m>?  Yes!  Homework!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now consider the group <m>U(p)</m> where <m>p</m> is prime.  This is the group of <em>units</em> mod <m>p</m>, which means <m>\{1,2,3,\ldots, p-1\}</m> (which is a consequence of Bezout's lemma).  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Thus in <m>U(p)</m> we have <m>g^{p-1} = 1</m> for all <m>g \in U(p)</m>.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Therefore <m>a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}</m>.  This result is called<em>Fermat's Little Theorem</em>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  Now what about the non-prime case?  Given <m>n</m>, is there a number <m>m</m> such that <m>a^m \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m> for all <m>a</m>?  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
        The answer is no, since if <m>a</m> and <m>n</m> have a common factor, then no power of <m>a</m> will be 1 mod <m>n</m>.   
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        Working in groups again, we can consider <m>U(n)</m>.  The elements of this group are precisely the <em>units</em> of <m>Z_n</m>, which means those elements relatively prime to <m>n</m>.  
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
        We will let <m>\varphi(n)</m> denote the <em>number</em> of numbers less than <m>n</m> that are relatively prime to <m>n</m>.  This is called the <term>Euler <m>\varphi</m> function</term>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Then repeating the same argument as we did for Fermat's Little Theorem, we get that <m>a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m> for any <m>a</m> relatively prime to <m>n</m>.  This is known as Euler's Theorem.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  For Euler's theorem to be useful, we need to understand how the <m>\varphi</m> function behaves.  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        We know that <m>\varphi(p) = p-1</m> for any prime <m>p</m>.  We also will define <m>\varphi(1) = 1</m> (because it will be useful to do so).  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The definition of <m>\varphi(n)</m> is: the number of positive integers less than <m>n</m> that are relatively prime to <m>n</m>.  Find <m>\varphi(n)</m> by brute force for some non-prime values of <m>n</m>. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In particular, find <m>\varphi(6)</m>, <m>\varphi(10)</m>, <m>\varphi(14)</m>, <m>\varphi(15)</m>, and <m>\varphi(21)</m>.  Note that each of these is the product of two primes.  
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <m>\varphi(4) = 2</m>, <m>\varphi(6) = 2</m>, <m>\varphi(8) = </m>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
