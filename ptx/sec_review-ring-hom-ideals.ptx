      In the study of groups,
      a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the group.
      Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and multiplication in the ring.
      More specifically, if <m>R</m> and <m>S</m> are rings,
      then a <term>ring homomorphism</term>
          <idx><h>Homomorphism</h><h>ring</h></idx>
          <idx><h>Ring</h><h>homomorphism</h></idx>

      <md permid="OFm">
        <mrow>\phi( a + b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) + \phi(b)</mrow>
        <mrow>\phi( a b ) &amp; = \phi( a ) \phi(b)</mrow>
      </md>
      for all <m>a, b \in R</m>.
      If <m>\phi : R \rightarrow S</m> is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism,
      then <m>\phi</m> is called an <term>isomorphism</term>
          <idx><h>Isomorphism</h><h>ring</h></idx>

      The set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to <m>0</m> plays a fundamental role in the theory of rings.

      In group theory we found that normal subgroups play a special role.
      These subgroups have nice characteristics that make them more interesting to study than arbitrary subgroups.
      In ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings called ideals.
      An <term>ideal</term><idx><h>Ideal</h><h>definition of</h></idx> in a ring <m>R</m> is a subring <m>I</m> of <m>R</m> such that if <m>a</m> is in <m>I</m> and <m>r</m> is in <m>R</m>,
