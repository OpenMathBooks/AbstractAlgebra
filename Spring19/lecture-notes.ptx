		<title>Order</title>

		<p>
			The <em>order</em> of an element <m>g</m> in a group is the least <m>n</m> such that <m>g^n = e</m> (if there is such an <m>n</m>, otherwise we say the order is infinite). Start by investigating the order of elements in <m>S_5</m>. What can we say about the order of a permutation in <m>S_n</m> based on the length of the disjoint cycles we use to represent it?

			<title>Order of Group Elements</title>

			<p>
				Now we want to do this more in general – in any group <m>G</m>, we can consider the order of the elements of <m>G</m>. First we should consider exponents.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				When <m>G</m> is written multiplicatively, we use the shorthand <m>a^n</m> to mean <m>a</m> multiplied with itself <m>n</m> times.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Write <m>a^{-n}</m> to mean <m>a^{-1}</m> multiplied by itself <m>n</m> times. <m>a^0 = e</m> by convention.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We have the usual rules of exponents: <m>a^ma^n = a^{m+n}</m>, <m>(a^m)^n = a^{mn}</m> and <m>a^{-n} = (a^{-1})^n = (a^n)^{-1}</m>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Do you believe these? How would you prove them? (A good thing to think about if you are going to teach algebra).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				What if <m>G</m> was written additively? We don’t use exponents then: instead of <m>a^n</m> we write <m>na = a+a+\cdots + a</m>. Do multiples follow the same rules as exponents?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Unless we need to for some good reason, we stick to multiplicative notation, so will use exponents.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there exists a nonzero integer <m>m</m> such that <m>a^m = e</m>, then the <em>order</em> of the element <m>a</m> is the least positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>a^n = e</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				If there does not exists such an integer, we say that <m>a</m> has <em>order infinity</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We write <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m> for the order of <m>a</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Some examples. What are the orders of the elements in <m>\mathbb Z_6</m> (this should be written additively). What are the orders of the elements in <m>D_4</m>? What is the order of the elements in <m>\mathbb Z</m>?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now if the order of an element <m>a</m> is <m>n</m>, then <m>n</m> is the smallest positive integer such that <m>a^n = e</m>. But there might be other numbers <m>t</m> such that <m>a^t = e</m> as well. What can we say about these?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It should be easy to see that if <m>t</m> is a multiple of <m>n</m>, then <m>a^t = e</m>. But is this the <em>only</em> way to get the identity? That is, if <m>a^t = e</m>, must <m>t</m> be a multiple of <m>n</m>? Why?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Yes. To prove it, we need to use the <em>division algorithm</em> (for <m>\mathbb Z</m>): If <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are integers and <m>n</m> is positive, then there exists unique integers <m>q</m> and <m>r</m> such that <m>m = nq + r</m> where <m>0 \le r &lt; n</m>. (<m>q</m> is the quotient, <m>r</m> is the remainder when we divide <m>m</m> by <m>n</m>.)
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Why does this help? Well suppose <m>a^t = e</m>. Now we can divide <m>t</m> by <m>n</m>, and we get <m>t = nq + r</m>. So we have <me>a^t = a^{nq+r} = a^{nq}a^r = (a^n)^qa^r = e^q a^r = a^r</me> But that means <m>a^r = e</m> - which is impossible because <m>r &lt; n</m>. Unless <m>r = 0</m>. But then <m>t = nq</m> so <m>t</m> is a multiple of <m>n</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>

			<title>Orders of elements and subgroups</title>

			<p>
				Last time we explored the orders of elements in groups. We noted that if the order of <m>a \in G</m> was <m>n</m>, then the only way for <m>a^t = e</m> is if <m>t</m> is a multiple of <m>n</m>. This used the division algorithm.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also looked at a specific example: <m>G = S_5</m>. Here, we found that for any <m>\alpha \in S_5</m> it was the case that <m>\alpha^{120} = (1)</m> (where <m>120</m> is the number of elements of <m>S_5</m>). We proved that this is the case because we were able to prove that the only orders of elements in <m>S_5</m> were <m>1, 2, \ldots, 6</m>, and each of these divide 120. But will a similar thing happen in all groups?
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				First, we will consider what the different powers of <m>a \in G</m> look like. Say the order of <m>a</m> is <m>n</m>. So we know that <m>a^n = e</m>, and for any <m>0 \le k &lt; n</m>, we have <m>a^k \ne e</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We can say more. No two powers of <m>a</m> less than <m>n</m> are the same: there must be exactly <m>n</m> different powers of <m>a</m>: <m>a^0, a^1, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}</m>. How do we know this?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				First note that there cannot be any <em>other</em> powers of <m>a</m>: consider <m>a^m</m>. Write <m>m = nq + r</m>. Then <me>a^m = a^{nq+r} = a^{nq}a^r = a^r</me> But <m>0 \le r &lt; n</m> so <m>a^m</m> is always one of the <m>n</m> powers of <m>a</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Do those <m>n</m> powers of <m>a</m> all need to be different? Well what if they weren’t? Then <m>a^r = a^s</m> for <m>0\le s &lt; r &lt; n</m> (say <m>r</m> is the larger of the two). In other words, <m>0 &lt; r-s &lt; n</m>. Now multiply both sides of <m>a^r = a^s</m> by <m>a^{-s}</m>: <me>a^r a^{-s} = a^sa^{-s}</me> <me>a^r a^{-s} = e</me> <me>a^{r-s} = e</me> But <m>r-s &lt;n</m> which is the <em>least</em> power of <m>a</m> which give the identity. So <m>r -s = 0</m>, or in other words, <m>r = s</m> so <m>a^r = a^s</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				By the same argument, if <m>a</m> has order infinity, different powers of <m>a</m> always give different elements of <m>G</m>. That is, if <m>r \ne s</m>, then <m>a^r \ne a^s</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This has the following crucial consequence. If <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a) = n</m>, then <m>|\langle a \rangle| = n</m>. That is, the order of the subgroup generated by <m>a</m> is equal to the order of the element <m>a</m>. (Note the two uses of the word order).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Remember, we are trying to decide whether <m>a^{|G|} = e</m> for all <m>a \in G</m>. This will happen as long as <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m> divides <m>|G|</m>. But now we know that there is a subgroup of <m>G</m> that has size <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Perhaps we can say something about the size of the subgroups of <m>G</m>? Yes we can!
			</p>

			<p>
				Let <m>G</m> be a finite group and <m>H</m> any subgroup of <m>G</m>. Then the order of <m>G</m> is a multiple of the order of <m>H</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is hard to express just how amazing this theorem is. We proved it last semester. But let’s quickly recall how the proof went.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				We simply count the number of cosets you get from a subgroup <m>H</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Given any subgroup <m>H &lt; G</m>, we can always form cosets <m>\{aH ~:~a \in G\}</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Each of these cosets will have the same number of elements, the same number of elements as <m>H</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Further, the set of all cosets forms a <em>partition</em> of <m>G</m>: eveyr element is in one and only one coset.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So how many cosets are there? That is, what is the index of <m>H</m> in <m>G</m>? We have <m>[G:H] = |G|/|H|</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				But this is a whole number, so it must be that <m>|H|</m> divides <m>|G|</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				You might ask if this is really useful. Well what if, for example, the order of <m>G</m> is prime? Does <m>G</m> have any subgroups?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We will consider other implications of this theorem, including to RSA cryptography, next week.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				And back to our question: Since for any element <m>a \in G</m>, we can take <m>\langle a\rangle</m>, and the order of this cyclic subgroup is just the <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m>. But that means that <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m> must be a factor of the order of <m>G</m>!
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We end with an application of this result.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>

			<p>
				If <m>p</m> is prime and <m>a</m> is a positive integer less than <m>p</m>, then <m>a^p</m> divided by <m>p</m> has remainder <m>a</m>. That is, <m>a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}</m>. Hint: look at the group <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m>. (This famous result is known as <em>Fermat’s Little Theorem</em>.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Recall that the group <m>\mathbb Z_p^* = \{1,2,3,\ldots, p-1\}</m> under multiplication modulo <m>p</m>. In other words, after we multiply elements in <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m>, we look for the remainder when the number is divided by <m>p</m>. So to find the remainder when <m>a^p</m> is divided by <m>p</m>, we can simply calculate <m>a^p</m> in the group <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				As long as <m>p</m> is prime, <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m> really is a group. The identity is 1. Now let <m>a</m> be any number less than <m>p</m>. What can we say about the order of <m>a</m> in <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m>? Well by Lagrange’s theorem, <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a)</m> must divide <m>p-1</m>, since <m>p-1</m> is the order of <m>\mathbb Z_p^*</m>. Call <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a) = k</m>. So <m>p-1 = mk</m> for some <m>m</m>. Thus <m>a^{p-1} = a^{mk} = 1</m>. Then <m>a^p = 1\cdot a = a</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Today we investigated Euler’s theorem, that <m>a^{\varphi(n)} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}</m> as long as <m>a</m> and <m>n</m> are relatively prime, where <m>\varphi(n)</m> denotes the number of numbers less than <m>n</m> that are relatively prime to <m>n</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some things we noticed: <m>\varphi(p) = p-1</m> for prime numbers <m>p</m>. It also appears that <m>\varphi(pq) = \varphi(p)\varphi(q)</m> where <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are prime. We will prove this next time.

		<subsection class="unnumbered" xml:id="public-key-cryptography">
			<title>Public Key Cryptography</title>

			<p>
				Here is the idea: we want to publicly publish an encryption key that can be used to encode data, that cannot be decrypted unless you know the private decryption key.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				How do we encode the message? First, suppose you have some standard method to make the message into a number (or sequence of numbers). Call such a number <m>x</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now we want to transform <m>x</m> into a encrypted number <m>y</m>. We do this by computing <m>x^E \pmod{n}</m> for some numbers <m>E</m> and <m>n</m>. Then <m>y</m> can be sent.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				For this to work, we need a way to transform <m>y</m> back into <m>x</m>. We will do this by computing <m>y^D \pmod{n}</m>. This would only be secure if <m>D</m> was completely private (so we better not be able to find <m>D</m> from <m>E</m> and <m>n</m>). It would only work if this really did give <m>x</m> back.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So we want <m>(x^E)^D \cong x \pmod{n}</m>. How can we make sure this happens?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				What if <m>DE = \varphi(n)+1</m>? Or even <m>DE = k\varphi(n)+1</m>? Well, if it happens that <m>x</m> is relatively prime to <m>n</m>, we would have <me>(x^E)^D = x^{DE} = x^{k\varphi(n)}x \equiv 1^k x \pmod{n}</me>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				If <m>x</m> is not relatively prime to <m>n</m>, then we will also be okay, because of how we will pick <m>n</m>.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				We will have <m>n = pq</m> for primes <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>. Say <m>x</m> is a multiple of <m>p</m> (but not of <m>q</m>).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So <m>x = rp</m> for some <m>r &lt; q</m>. Then <me>x^{km} = x^{k\varphi(pq)} = (x^\varphi(q))^{k\varphi(p)} \equiv 1 \pmod q</me>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This means that <m>x^{k\varphi(pq)} = 1 + tq</m> for some <m>t</m>. We get <me>(x^E)^D = x^{k\varphi(pq)}x = (1+tq)x = x + tq(rp) = x+trn \equiv x \pmod n</me>
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Great. So we want <m>DE = k\varphi(n) + 1</m> which is the same as saying <m>DE \equiv 1 \pmod{\varphi(n)}</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We also want <m>n = pq</m>, so <m>\varphi(n) = \varphi(p)\varphi(q) = (p-1)(q-1)</m>. Use <m>m = \varphi(n)</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So here is what we want to do:
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Pick two really big prime number <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>; find <m>n = pq</m> and <m>m = (p-1)(q-1)</m> (these are easy if we start with <m>p</m> and <m>q</m>).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Find a number <m>E</m> that is relatively prime to <m>m</m>. Just guess and check until you find something.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Find <m>D</m> such that <m>DE \equiv 1 \pmod{m}</m>. You can do this using the Euclidean algorithm. You will be successful because <m>\gcd(E, m) = 1</m>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Don’t tell anyone what <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, <m>m</m> or <m>D</m> are. Tell everyone what <m>n</m> and <m>E</m> are.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Note: we want <m>E</m> to be fairly large. Taking <m>E = 2</m> would always work, but then you could undo the encryption by searching for a square root perhaps. Other considerations are whether it is efficient to compute <m>x^E</m>, which is easier if in binary <m>E</m> doesn’t have too many 1’s.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Work through an example with small primes. Have a student write down their favorite number <m>x</m> (in secret) and then compute <m>x^E \pmod n</m> (in secret). Then as a class, decrypt the result.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				One concern is how to compute the power mod <m>n</m> in any sort of reasonable way. We can use the method of repeated squares:
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				First, write <m>E</m> as a sum of powers of 2 (like the Egyptians would).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So now we just need to compute <m>x^{2^{k_1}+2^{k_2}+ \cdots + 2^{k_n}}</m>. This becomes a product of terms for the form <m>x^{2^k}</m> for different <m>k</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Notice though that <m>x^{2^k} = (x^2)^{2^{k-1}}</m>. In other words, we can keep squaring <m>x</m>, <m>k</m> times.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This doesn’t seem to help, except that we can reduce mod <m>n</m> at each step. So as long as we can square a number less than <m>n</m>, we are good.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>

		<subsection class="unnumbered" xml:id="cauchys-theorem-for-abelian-groups">
			<title>Cauchy’s Theorem for Abelian Groups</title>

			<p>
				Our goal is to understand the structure of groups better. What does this mean? One example of what we are after is Lagrange’s Theorem: if you have a group containing exactly <m>14</m> elements, could any of those elements have order 5? Lagrange says no! In fact, we know that the only possible orders are 1, 2, 7, and 14, the divisors of 14. Note that knowing about order is one step in understanding what the subgroups of a group look like (since this tells us that the cyclic subgroups look like).
			</p>

			<p>
				A natural question: does our arbitrary group of 14 elements necessarily have elements of order 2 and 7? Of 14? That is, to what extent is the <em>converse</em> of Lagrange’s theorem true? Perhaps investigate this for the group <m>A_4</m>, which has size 12. What orders of elements are there? Is there any subgroup of size 6?
			</p>

			<p>
				Today we will prove Cauchy’s theorem for abelian groups: if <m>G</m> is a finite abelian group and a prime <m>p</m> divides <m>|G|</m>, then there is an element of order <m>p</m> in <m>G</m>.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Before we get to that, think about the style of proof that will be needed here. We want to show something is true for all finite abelian groups. In other words, all abelian groups of all finite orders. Perhaps we could use induction?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In fact, we will want to use <em>strong</em> induction, since it is not at all clear how to make a group containing 1 fewer element. For fun, we will give a version of strong induction proofs known as proof by <q>minimal criminal</q>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Let’s do an example of this with numbers: prove that every number greater than 1 is either prime or is the product of primes.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Suppose this was not the case. What would a counterexample look like? It can’t be 2 or 3 or 4 or…, but if there were a counterexample, there would need to be a <em>least</em> counterexample. This would be the <em>minimal criminal</em>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The minimal criminal <m>n</m> cannot be prime (otherwise it is not a counterexample). So because it is greater than 1, it must be composite. So <m>n = ab</m> for some numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> both greater than 1. But also <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are less than <m>n</m>, so they are not counterexamples.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Thus <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are both either prime or the product of primes? Write them as such.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This makes <m>n</m> the product of primes (or the product of products of primes, which is the same thing). A contradiction.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				How might this help us with groups? Well suppose we wanted to show something was true for all finite groups. The standard induction framework would ask us to prove that it is true for all groups of order <m>1</m> (base case), and also show that <em>if</em> it is true of all groups of order less than <m>n</m> <em>then</em> it is true of all groups of order <m>n</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In terms of minimal criminals, we would assume there was a counterexample, and let <m>G</m> be a group of smallest order for which the thing we wanted to show was false. Now do something to get a group <m>H</m> of order less than <m>n</m>. The result holds of <m>H</m>. Use that fact to go back to <m>G</m> and conclude the same for <m>G</m>, contradicting the assumption there was a counterexample.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We will prove that if <m>G</m> is a finite abelian group and a prime <m>p</m> divides <m>|G|</m>, then there is an element of order <m>p</m> in <m>G</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This is clearly true if <m>|G| = 1</m>, since there is no such prime. Now suppose <m>G</m> is an arbitrary group of order <m>n</m> and let <m>p</m> be a prime dividing <m>n</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				First, what if there is an element <m>a</m> with <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(a) = tp</m> for some integer <m>t</m>? Will there be an element of order <m>p</m> then? This does not use induction.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now let <m>a</m> be an element which has order NOT a multiple of <m>p</m>. What can we say about <m>\langle a\rangle</m> and the quotient group <m>G/\langle a \rangle</m>? Specifically, is the size of the quotient group less than <m>n</m>? Is it a multiple of <m>p</m>?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Since <m>G/\langle a \rangle</m> is a group (we know <m>\langle a \rangle</m> is a normal subgroup since <m>G</m> is abelian) with order less than <m>n</m>, we know that the result applies to it (this is the inductive hypothesis). Since <m>p</m> divides the order of <m>G/\langle a \rangle</m>, we know this quotient group contains an element of order <m>p</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Call that element <m>Hb</m> (since elements in the quotient group are cosets). So <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(Hb) = p</m>. What does this say about <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(b)</m> in <m>G</m>? Well let <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(b) = k</m>. Then <m>b^k = e</m> so <m>(Hb)^k = He = H</m>. So <m>k</m> is a multiple of <m>p</m>. So <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(b) = tp</m> for some <m>p</m>, and thus there is an element in <m>G</m> of order <m>p</m> (namely <m>b^t</m>).

			<title>Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups</title>

			<p>
				The goal today is to understand how to classify all finite abelian groups.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Some abelian groups are cyclic. And if they are, we know exactly what they look like. They are isomorphic to <m>\mathbb Z_{n}</m> for some <m>n</m> (and this happens precisely when there is an element of order <m>n</m> in the group).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				But not all abelian groups are cyclic. In fact, even <m>\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2</m> is an example of this. So what does an abelian group look like in general?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Note that if a group is not cyclic, then it is not generated by a single element. But it will be generated by some number of elements. There are groups that are <em>finitely generated</em> and others that are not (require an infinite set of generators). Of course finite groups are finitely generated.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				If <m>g_1</m>, <m>g_2</m>, …<m>g_n</m> is a set of generators, that means that every element of the group can be written as a product of powers of these elements. If the group is abelian, then we can say each element <m>g \in G</m> is <m>g = g_1^{k_1}g_2^{k_2}\ldots g_n^{k_n}</m>. Some of the <m>k_i</m> might be negative or zero.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now the powers of <m>g_1</m> are exactly the elements of the cyclic subgroup <m>\langle g_1\rangle</m>, and similarly for all <m>g_i</m>. So this says that <m>G = \langle g_1\rangle\langle g_2\rangle\cdots\langle g_n\rangle</m>. So perhaps you would think that <m>G</m> could be written as an <em>internal</em> direct product of cyclic groups.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				To make sure that were true, we would also need <m>\langle a_i \rangle \cap \langle a_j\rangle = \{e\}</m> (the other requirement, that the subgroups are normal, we get for free since we are in an abelian group).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This will not always be true. In <m>\mathbb Z_{12}</m>, if we picked <m>a_1 = 3</m> and <m>a_2 = 6</m>, then we are done for.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So we must pick the generators carefully. We pick them based on what their orders are.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Given any abelian group <m>G</m>, let <m>G(p)</m> be the set of all elements whose orders are a power of <m>p</m>. For prime <m>p</m>, we call such groups <em><m>p</m>-groups</em>. Our first step is to break <m>G</m> down as the direct product of <m>p</m>-groups.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Specifically, say <m>|G| = p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\cdots p_n^{k_n}</m>. We can show that <m>G</m> is the internal direct product of <m>G(p_1)</m>, <m>G(p_2)</m>,…<m>G(p_n)</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				It is easy to verify that <m>G(p_i)</m> is really a subgroup. Thus we must only argue that <m>G(p_i)\cap G(p_j) = \{e\}</m> for all <m>i \ne j</m> and that <m>G = G(p_1)G(p_2)\cdots G(p_n)</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The first is easy (by a homework problem you did in fact: no power of one is equal to a power of another).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The other must be true because we know that the product of these subgroups is at very least a subgroup of <m>G</m>, but it must have the same size, and therefore be equal to <m>G</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So now we have the <m>G</m> is a direct product of <m>p</m>-groups. These <m>p</m>-groups might or might not be cyclic (consider the two examples we had on the activity from last time).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We need to understand the structure of <m>p</m>-groups. It would be nice to pick generators so that the <m>p</m>-group could be expressed as the direct product of cyclic groups (all of which will also be <m>p</m>-groups).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Again, do so by considering the order of elements. Say we have a <m>p</m>-group <m>G_p</m>. Let <m>g</m> be any one of the elements in <m>G_p</m> of maximal order. So <m>\mathop{\mathrm{ord}}(g) = p^m</m> for some <m>m</m>. We will show that <m>G_p = \langle g \rangle \times H</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G_p</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This will be enough, because then we can proceed by induction to break down <m>H</m> (also a <m>p</m>-group, but of smaller order) similarly. Eventually we will be left with a second group that is cyclic (or trivial).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Here is the basic idea. The proof is by induction. We take <m>g</m> to be of largest order in <m>G_p</m>. Let <m>h</m> be of smallest order of all elements not in <m>\langle g\rangle</m>. Then shift to the quotient group <m>G/\langle h\rangle</m> and look at the element <m>\langle h\rangle g</m>. Argue that this has maximal order in <m>G/\langle h\rangle</m> and by induction conclude that <m>G/\langle h\rangle \cong \langle \langle h\rangle g\rangle \times H/\langle h\rangle</m> for some subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> containing <m>\langle h\rangle</m>. Then argue that this <m>H</m> makes <m>G_p \cong \langle g \rangle \times H</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The takeaway: The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups tells us that any finite abelian group <m>G</m> is isomorphic to the direct product of cyclic groups, each of order a power of a prime. That is, <me>G \cong \mathbb Z_{p_1^{k_1}}\times \mathbb Z_{p_2^{k_2}}\times \cdots \times\mathbb Z_{p_n^{k_n}}</me> (the <m>p_i</m> need not be distinct).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				As an example, let’s classify all finite abelian groups of order <m>540 = 2^2 3^3 5</m>. One of these is <m>\mathbb Z_{2^2} \times \mathbb Z_{3^3} \times \mathbb Z_5</m>. Another is <m>\mathbb Z_{2}\times\mathbb Z_2\times\times \mathbb Z_{3^3} \times \mathbb Z_5</m>. Or we can break down the <m>3^3</m> in two different ways. All together there will be 6 groups with this order.
			</p>
				</li>

				The goal today is to gain familiarity with the definitions of subnormal and normal series, and to understand what a composition or principle series is. This will lead to the definition of a solvable group.
			</p>

			<p>
				One preliminary is the notion of a <em>simple group</em>. These are groups that have no non-trivial normal subgroups. One of the great accomplishments of algebra recently is the complete classification of all finite simple groups in 2008. It turns out that the simple groups are only

				Motivating question: Let <m>G</m> be a group with normal subgroup <m>H</m>. Suppose <m>G/H</m> is not simple (that is, it has a normal subgroup). What does that tell us about the relationship between <m>G</m> and <m>H</m>?

				The Jordan-Hölder Theorem: Any two composition series of <m>G</m> are isomorphic. By isomorphic, we mean there is a 1-1 correspondence between the quotient groups in the composition series.

				<li>
							<p>
				This is really remarkable. It says that however you decompose a group using a subnormal series, you will essentially get the same series (in as much as the quotient groups will match up). In particular, the <em>length</em> of composition series is well defined.
			</p>

				<li>
							<p>
				Another useful definition is this: A group <m>G</m> is <em>solvable</em> if it has a subnormal series <m>\{H_i\}</m> such that all the quotient groups <m>H_{i+1}/H_{i}</m> are abelian. Next week we will see why calling such groups <q>solvable</q> makes sense.

		<title>Back to Fields</title>

		<p>
			Here is the main question we asked after the last exam: What do the roots of <m>x^5 - 5x - 2</m> look like? Is there something analogous to the quadratic formula that will tell us the roots?
		</p>

		<p>
			Approach: Describe the splitting field <m>E</m>, and consider <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> and its subgroups. Use properties of groups to say something interesting about the subgroups. Translate this back to say something interesting about the splitting field (and its subfields). Translate that to say something about the polynomial.
		</p>

		<p>
			Today, let’s remind ourselves about what we know from Galois theory.
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			Given a polynomial <m>p(x)</m>, we can find its <em>splitting field</em> <m>E</m>, the smallest extension field in which the polynomial factors into linear terms (splits).
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We can look at automorphisms of the splitting field that <em>fix</em> the base field (usually <m>\mathbb Q</m>, which has to be fixed anyway).
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			These automorphisms must send roots of irreducible polynomials to roots of the same irreducible polynomial. If <m>p(x)</m> is not irreducible, then we need to look at its irreducible factors to see what the automorphisms look like.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The set of all <m>\mathbb Q</m>-fixing automorphisms of <m>E</m> forms a group (under composition) called the <em>Galois group of <m>E</m> over <m>\mathbb Q</m></em>, written <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			There is a strong connection between the field extension and the Galois group, which is the content of the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory</em>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			One of these is that the size of the Galois group is equal to the degree of the field extension. But there is more.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			If we look at a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m>, we get a subset of the automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>\mathbb Q</m>. We consider the set of elements in <m>E</m> that are fixed by all the automorphisms in <m>H</m>. This is a field <m>F</m>, and thus an <em>intermediate field</em> between <m>\mathbb Q</m> and <m>E</m>. We call it the <em>fixed field</em> of <m>H</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			On the other hand, if we take an intermediate field <m>I</m> (so <m>\mathbb Q\subset I \subset E</m>) we can consider <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:I)</m>, the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>I</m>. We call this group the <em>fixer</em> of <m>I</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			These match up exactly! We could prove: If <m>H</m> is the fixer of <m>I</m>, then <m>I</m> is the fixed field of <m>H</m>, and if <m>I</m> is the fixed field of <m>H</m>, then <m>H</m> is the fixer of <m>I</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			And it gets even better. Suppose that <m>I</m> is not just an intermediate field, but is itself a splitting field from some polynomial. In this case it makes sense to consider <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(I:\mathbb Q)</m> as well.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			These are automorphisms of <m>I</m> that fix <m>\mathbb Q</m>. Now technically none of these automorphisms belong to <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m>, but they are related. By a homomorphism!
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			Given an automorphism in <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m>, consider its restriction to <m>I</m>. That is, simply restrict the domain to only include elements from <m>I</m>. It turns out that the function that takes a automorphism to its restriction is a homomorphism. And where there’s a homomorphism, there is a kernel. These will be the automorphisms of <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> which are the identity on <m>I</m>. That is, exactly the elements of <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:I)</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			So by the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, <me>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(I:\mathbb Q) \cong [\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)]/[\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:I)]</me> In particular, we see that the fixer of a splitting field is a normal subgroup.
		</p>

		<p>
			Show the Galois correspondence for the whole diagram of intermediate fields of <m>\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The field <m>\mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{7})</m> has Galois group isomorphic to <m>\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2</m>. Consider the two subnormal series <me>\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2 \supset \langle (1,0,0), (0,1,0)\rangle \supset \{(0,0,0)\}</me> <me>\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2 \supset \langle (0,0,1)\rangle \supset \{(0,0,0)\}</me> What intermediate fields do these match up with?

			<title>Polynomials Solvable by Radicals</title>

			<p>
				Today we will try to understand why there is nothing like the quadratic formula for polynomials in general. Specifically, there is no quintic (or higher) formula.
			</p>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				What do we mean by something like the quadratic formula? We mean solvability by radicals. That is, is there some way to express the roots of a polynomial in terms of field operations and <m>n</m>th roots?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				This question can be framed in the language of extension fields. Remember, we know that every polynomial has roots in some extension field. Asking what the roots look like is asking what the extension field looks like.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				In particular, we need to see if the roots lie in a field extension obtained by taking <m>n</m>th roots of elements in lower fields.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We say that an extension <m>E</m> of a field <m>F</m> is an <em>extension by radicals</em> if there is a chain of subfields <me>F = F_0 \subseteq F_1 \subseteq F_2 \subseteq \cdots \subseteq F_r = E</me> such that for <m>i = 1,2,\ldots, 3</m> we have <m>F_i = F_{k-1}(\alpha_i)</m> and <m>\alpha_i^{n_i} \in F_{i-1}</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Then a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> is <em>solvable by radicals</em> over <m>F</m> if the splitting field <m>K</m> of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>F</m> is contained in an extension of <m>F</m> by radicals.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				An easy example of a polynomial that is solvable by radicals is <m>x^n - a</m> (for any <m>a \in \mathbb Q</m>). We can say exactly what the roots look like. Let <m>\omega</m> be a primitive <m>n</m>th root of unity (what does this mean?), so the roots are <m>\sqrt[n]{a}\omega^{k}</m> for <m>k \in \{0,1,\ldots, n-1\}</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We wish to make a connection to groups. We do so using Galois theory. Let the splitting field for <m>x^n - a</m> over <m>\mathbb Q</m> be <m>E</m>. What does <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> look like?
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				First extend <m>\mathbb Q</m> by <m>\omega</m>. We can check that <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(\mathbb Q(\omega):\mathbb Q)</m> is abelian, and thus solvable. Then extend again to get <m>E</m> (we know <m>E \supseteq \mathbb Q(\omega)</m>). We can argue that <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q(\omega))</m> is also abelian, and thus solvable. Then put it together (look at the two series).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				What this says is that at least in this special case, since the polynomial is solvable by radicals, the splitting field’s Galois group is solvable. This holds in general. Essentially, just repeat the process for each extension (putting in the primitive roots of unity as required).
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The converse happens to also be true. So a polynomial is solvable by radicals if and only if the Galois group of its splitting field is a solvable group.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now consider the polynomial <m>p(x) = x^5 - 6x^3 - 27x - 3</m>. This is irreducible by Eisenstein. Thus there are 5 distinct roots in some splitting field <m>E</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				What do the roots look like? By either graphing or doing some calculus, we can verify that there are exactly three real roots (there are only two critical points). Thus there are exactly two complex roots.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The automorphisms of the splitting field are determined by what they do to the five roots. So each automorphism can be viewed as an element of <m>S_5</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				One automorphism is complex conjugation. This leaves the three real roots fixed, and permutes the other two. So in <m>S_5</m>, this is a transposition.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				We also know that <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> has order that is a multiple of 5. We get this by considering the tower of extensions of <m>\mathbb Q</m> in <m>E</m>: the first extension must be of degree 5, so the degree <m>[E:\mathbb Q]</m> is a multiple of 5, and this is the same as the order of <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m>. By Cauchy’s theorem, <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> must have an element of order 5. In <m>S_5</m> this is necessarily a 5-cycle.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				So <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q)</m> is a subgroup of <m>S_5</m> that contains a 2-cycle and a 5-cycle. We can show that this means that <m>\mathop{\mathrm{Gal}}(E:\mathbb Q) \cong S_5</m>. In fact, <m>S_5</m> is generated by any 2-cycle and any 5-cycle.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Now consider the composition series for <m>S_5</m>: <me>S_5 \supset A_5 \supset \{0\}</me> Since <m>A_5</m> is simple, we get that <m>S_5</m> is not solvable. And this means that <m>p(x)</m> is not solvable by radicals. Ta Daa.

		<title>Application to Counting</title>

		<p>
			Let’s end the year with an example of how understanding group structure can help solve problems in other areas of mathematics. Consider questions of combinatorics. In Discrete you learned a variety of methods for quickly counting the number of outcomes (this is also useful in probability of course).
		</p>

		<p>
			How many ways are there for King Arthur and his 9 knights of the round table to sit around the round table? Why is the answer not just 10 factorial?
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
					<p>
			One way to think about the above problem is to say that there are 10 seats, with 10 choices for who sits in the first, 9 choices for who sits in the second, and so on. But this is too many, since we just care who sits next to whom, not which chairs they sit in. So divide by 10 to account for the 10 different seating arrangements that should really count as one outcome.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			We have a similar way of correcting when we think of counting <em>combinations</em> instead of permutations.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			What about this problem: You want to put out place mats for Arthur and his knights. The mats come in two colors: blue and gold. How many ways can you arrange the place mats around the table?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			This is harder. We could start by saying there are <m>2^{10}</m> arrangements (each spot has 2 choices). But how do we divide out by the duplicates?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The problem is that the number of duplicates depends on the number of each color. For example, we have only counted 1 outcome where all the mats are gold. But we have counted 10 with 1 blue and 9 gold, and they are all <q>the same</q>. We have counted 45 with 2 blue and 8 gold. How many of those should we have counted?
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			This is getting complicated fast. It seems like while this way of dividing up the outcomes could work, it is certainly no easy task.
		</p>

			<li>
					<p>
			So here is an alternative suggestion. Instead of creating cases based on how many of each color we have, break up the set of distributions by the type of duplication.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			For example, we wanted to group together the 1 blue/9 gold placements because each could be achieved by rotating the table from another. So maybe lets group together all placements that are equivalent under this symmetry.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			The advantage: we understand symmetries fairly well: they give us a group structure. Here, the group of all rotations of a 10-gon, which is a subgroup of <m>D_{10}</m>.
		</p>
			</li>

			<li>
					<p>
			To make this precise, we will talk about the group <em>acting</em> on the set of outcomes (colorings). So let’s see what we can say about <q>group actions.</q>

			<title>Group Actions</title>

			<p><ul>
				<li>
							<p>
				Consider a group <m>G</m> and a set <m>X</m>. An <em>action</em> of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m> is a function that sends pairs in <m>G \times X</m> to things in <m>X</m>. We write <m>(g,x) \mapsto gx</m>, satisfying
			</p>

			<p><ol>
				<li>
							<p>
				<m>ex = x</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				<m>(g_1g_2)x = g_1(g_2x)</m> for all <m>x \in X</m> and all <m>g_1, g_2\in G</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ol></p>

			<p>
				We call <m>X</m> a <em><m>G</m>-set</em>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				Two elements <m>x, y \in X</m> are <em><m>G</m>-equivalent</em> (written <m>x \sim y</m>) provided there is some <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>gx = y</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The <em>orbit</em> of an element <m>x \in X</m> (written <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m>) is the set of all elements <m>y \in X</m> that are <m>G</m>-equivalent to <m>x</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The <em>fixed point set</em> of an element <m>g \in G</m> (written <m>X_g</m>) is the set of all <m>x \in X</m> such that <m>gx = x</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

				<li>
							<p>
				The <em>stabilizer subgroup</em> of an element <m>x \in X</m> (written <m>G_x</m>) is the set of all <m>g \in G</m> such that <m>gx = x</m>.
			</p>
				</li>

			</ul></p>

			<p>
				Do an example with <m>D_4</m> acting on the vertices (or edges) of a square.
			</p>

			<p>
				We would like to make some observations about how <m>G</m>, <m>X</m>, <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m>, <m>G_x</m> and <m>X_g</m> are related, in terms of sizes. We start with the <em>Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem</em>:
			</p>

			<p>
				Let <m>G</m> be a finite group acting on a set <m>X</m>. Then for any <m>x \in X</m>, <me>|G| = |\mathcal{O}_x|\cdot |G_x|</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Fix <m>x \in X</m> and consider the elements of <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m>. These are the elements <m>y \in X</m> such that <m>gx = y</m> for some <m>g \in G</m>. But of course there might be more than one element in <m>G</m> which moves <m>x</m> to <m>y</m>. Say <m>g_1x = y</m> and <m>g_2x = y</m>. Then <m>g_1x = g_2x</m> so <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 x = x</m>. In other words, <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the cosets <m>G/G_x</m> (remember <m>G_x</m> is a subgroup of <m>G</m>, so this makes sense). Each coset has the form <m>gG_x</m> for some <m>g \in G</m>. But look at what we said above: <m>g_2^{-1}g_1 \in G_x</m> precisely when <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> both move <m>x</m> to the same element in <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m>, and now we are saying that this happens exactly when <m>g_1</m> and <m>g_2</m> are in the same coset. So each different element of <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m> corresponds exactly to a coset of <m>G/G_x</m>. In other words: <me>|\mathcal{O}_x| = |G/G_x| = [G:G_x] = |G|/|G_x|</me> where the last equality is by Lagrange’s theorem.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let the <em>fixed point set</em> of an element <m>g \in G</m> (written <m>X_g</m>) be the set of all <m>x \in X</m> such that <m>gx = x</m>. Note here we are indexing by elements from <m>G</m>, instead of from <m>X</m> (as in <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m> or <m>G_x</m>).
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we can prove Burnside’s lemma:
			</p>

			<p>
				Let <m>k</m> be the number of distinct orbits defined by the action of <m>G</m> on <m>X</m>. Then <me>k = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X_g|.</me> In other words, the number of orbits is the average number of points fixed by the elements in <m>G</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let’s count <m>\sum_{g\in G} |X_g|</m>. This counts all the pairs <m>(g,x)</m> such that <m>g</m> fixes <m>x</m>. What if we break this down by <m>x</m> instead of <m>g</m>. We get <me>\sum_{g\in G} |X_g| = \sum_{x\in X} |G_x|</me> Now break it down even further: divide up the sum by orbits. For any single orbit <m>\mathcal{O}_x</m> we want to find <m>\sum_{y \in \mathcal{O}_x} |G_y|</m>. But if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in the same orbit, then <m>|G_x| = |G_y|</m><fn>			<p>
				How do we know this? Define <m>\varphi:G_x \to G_y</m> by <m>\varphi(a) = gag^{-1}</m> where <m>g</m> is the element which gives <m>gx = y</m>. You can show that <m>gag^{-1}y = y</m>. This is a isomorphism.
			</p></fn> so <me>\sum_{y \in \mathcal{O}_x} |G_y| = |\mathcal{O}_x|\cdot |G_x| = |G|</me> If we do this for all <m>k</m> orbits, we get <me>\sum_{x \in X} |G_x| = k\cdot |G|</me> but the left hand side is really <m>\sum_{g\in G} |X_g|</m>, as we need.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here are some examples.
			</p>

			<p>
				How many place mat placements are possible around Arthur’s 10 seat round table using blue and gold place mats? We count the number of orbits of elements in <m>X</m> under a group action of <m>G</m>. What are <m>X</m> and <m>G</m>? Let <m>X</m> be the set of all <q>colorings</q> (place mat placements) and let <m>G</m> be the group of rotations of a 10-gon (a subgroup of <m>D_{10}</m>). We need to find <m>|X_g|</m> for each element <m>g \in G</m> and then average them. How many colorings are fixed by the identity? All of them. What about by a rotation by 36 degrees? Just 2. Same for rotations by 3, 7, 9. Other rotations? We get: <me>\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X_g| = \frac{1}{10}(2^{10} + 4\cdot 2^1 + 4\cdot 2^2 + 2^5) = 108</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				How many 6-bead bracelets can you make using 3 colors of beads? Note we need all of <m>D_6</m> here. <me>\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X_g| = \frac{1}{12}(3^6+2\cdot 3^1 + 2\cdot 3^2 + 3^3 + 3\cdot 3^4 + 3\cdot 3^3 = 92</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				How many ways can you color the faces of a cube using 4 colors? We need to decide on the group of symmetries of a cube. This will be homework.
