\begin{questions}






\question[4] Suppose $E$ is a degree 2 extension of $F$.  Prove that $E$ is the splitting field for some polynomial in $F[x]$.

\begin{solution}
If $E$ is a degree 2 extension of $F$, then $E = F(c)$ where $c$ is the root to some irreducible degree 2 polynomial, $p(x)$.  We claim that $E$ is actually the splitting field for $p(x)$.  Note that in $E$, we can factor $p(x)$ as $(x-c)q(x)$ where $q(x)$ is a degree 1 polynomial with coefficients in $E$.  But this means that $q(x)$ has a root in $E$ as well: if $q(x) = ax + b$ then $\frac{b}{a}$ is a root, which is in $E$ because $a$ and $b$ are.  Thus $E$ contains all the roots of $p(x)$, as required.
\end{solution}



\question[6] Let $p(x)$ be a polynomial of degree $n$ in $F[x]$ for some field $F$.  Prove that there is a splitting field $E$ for $p(x)$ such that $[E:F] \le n!$.  Your proof must use \textbf{mathematical induction}!  Let $P(n)$ be the statement, ``If $p(x)$ has degree $n$, then there is a splitting field with degree no more than $n!$'' and prove $P(n)$ is true for all $n \ge 1$.  

\begin{solution}
We know that we can always find an extension of $F$ of degree at most $n$ (exactly $n$ if $p(x)$ is irreducible) which contains a root of $p(x)$.  In this larger field, we can factor $p(x)$ as $(x-c)q(x)$ where $c$ is the newly adjoined root of $p(x)$.  We now know that $q(x)$ has degree $n-1$.  Now repeat.  To make this rigorous, use induction.  

For the base case, it is clear that any polynomial of degree 1 has a splitting field $E$ with $[E:F] \le 1$, since $E = F$ works.  Now assume that the proposition is true for all polynomials of degree $k$.  Consider $p(x)$ of degree $k+1$.  Find an extension $F_1$ of $F$ in which $p(x)$ has a root.  Factor $p(x) = (x-c)q(x)$ in $F_1[x]$.  We have that $[F_1:F] \le k+1$.  Now $q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $k$, so we can apply our induction hypothesis to conclude that there is a splitting field $E$ for $q(x)$ extending $F_1$ with $[E:F_1] \le k!$.  But $E$ contains all the roots of $q(x)$, as well as $c$ (the other root of $p(x)$) so $E$ is a splitting field for $p(x)$ extending $F$.  By the tower rule, $[E:F]\le (k+1)!$.
\end{solution}

%\question Let $\varphi:F\to F$ be an automorphism.  Prove that if $f(a) = b$, then $a$ and $b$ are roots to the same polynomial.  That is, any polynomial that has $a$ as a root also has $b$ are a root.
\question[8] Consider the field $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)$. 
\begin{parts}
	 \part Is this a splitting field for some polynomial in $\Q[x]$?  If so, what is the degree of that polynomial? 
	 \begin{solution}
		 Yes, since in this field $x^4 - 3$ factors completely (its roots are $\pm \sqrt[4]{3}$ and $\pm \sqrt[4]{3}i$).  So it is the splitting field of a degree 4 polynomial.  
		 
		 It is also the splitting field of a degree 8 polynomial.  We know there is some element $\alpha$ of the field such that $\Q(\alpha)$ is the field.  This number will have a degree 8 minimal polynomial, and that polynomial will split completely in the field.
	 \end{solution}
	 \part What is the degree $[\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i):\Q]$?  Explain how you know.
	 \begin{solution}
		 This is degree 8.  We know that $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3})$ has degree 4 over $\Q$, but that this is only real, so adding $i$ will be more than a degree 1 extension.  However, $i$ has minimal polynomial $x^2 + 1$, so it will be a degree 2 extension of $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3})$.  Using the tower rule, we get degree 8.
	 \end{solution}
	 \part Draw as much of a complete tower diagram as you can describing the fields between $\Q$ and $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}, i)$.
	 \begin{solution}
		 You don't need to have all of this, but here is the complete tower diagram for this field.

	 \part Prove that the fields $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3})$ and $\Q(\sqrt[4]{3}i)$ are isomorphic, but not equal.  This might help with the previous parts.
	 \begin{solution}
		 Since $p(x) = x^4 - 3$ is the minimal polynomial for both $\sqrt[4]{3}$ and $\sqrt[4]{3}i$, we have that both fields are isomorphic to $\Q[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle$, so are therefore isomorphic to each other.
		 
		 However, the fields are not equal, since the first field contains only real numbers but the second field contains complex numbers.

% \question[4] In class we found the splitting field for the polynomial $x^3 + 2$, and saw that it had degree 6 over $\Q$.  


\question[12] Consider the polynomial $a(x) = x^4 -10x^2 + 21$ in $\Q[x]$.  
\begin{parts}
\part Find the splitting field $E$ over $\Q$.  Draw a tower diagram including all intermediate fields, and their degrees.  Hint: start by factoring $a(x)$.
\begin{solution}
The polynomial factors in $\Q[x]$ as $(x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 7)$.  Thus a splitting field is $E = \Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{7})$.
\end{solution}

\part Let $\Q(\alpha) \ne \Q(\beta)$ be different intermediate fields between $\Q$ and $E$.  Explain why there is NOT an isomorphism from $\Q(\alpha)$ to $\Q(\beta)$.  In particular, say why no isomorphism can send $\alpha$ to $\beta$.

\begin{solution}
We have $\alpha = \sqrt{3}$ and $\beta = \sqrt{7}$, for example.  Suppose there were an isomorphism between $\Q(\sqrt{3})$ and $\Q(\sqrt{7})$, call it $\varphi$.  Then $\varphi(\sqrt{3}) = a+b\sqrt{7}$ for some $a, b \in \Q$.  But then $\varphi(3) = \varphi(\sqrt{3})\varphi(\sqrt{3}) = a^2 + 2ab\sqrt{7} + b^27$.  We know though that $\varphi(3) = 3$ since $3 \in \Q$.  So this says that 
\[3 = a^2 + 2ab\sqrt{7} + 7b^2.\]
Since $\sqrt{7} \notin \Q$ this would mean either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$, but if $a = 0$ then $3/7$ would be a perfect square (it is not) and if $b =0$ then $3 = a^2$ which is also false.  Thus there is no place for $\sqrt{3}$ to go under the isomorphism, so there is no isomorphism.
\end{solution}


\part Describe a non-trivial \emph{automorphism} of $E$.  Explain how you know your example works. Remember, an automorphism is an isomorphism from $E$ to itself (that is, it moves some of the elements of $E$ around, but is still a bijection satisfying the homomorphism property).

\begin{solution}
Any automorphism must send roots of irreducible polynomials to roots of the \emph{same} irreducible polynomial.  So we could send $\sqrt{3}$ to $-\sqrt{3}$, or $\sqrt{7}$ to $-\sqrt{7}$ (or both).  In fact, we know that we can start with either of these and extend to an automorphism of the splitting field.  So one automorphism is determined by $\sigma(\sqrt{3}) = -\sqrt{3}$ and $\sigma(\sqrt{7}) = \sqrt{7}$ (the other basis element, $\sqrt{21}$ will have $\sigma(\sqrt{21}) = -\sqrt{21}$ due to the homomorphism property).
\end{solution}


\part Describe the Galois group $\Gal(E:\Q)$ for $E$ over $\Q$.  Be sure to explicitly say what each element of the group is, as well as say what ``standard'' group it is isomorphic to.
\begin{solution}
The Galois group contains all the automorphisms of $E$ which fix $\Q$.  This means that the automorphisms must send roots to irreducible polynomials to other roots of the same irreducible polynomial.  We also know that since $[E:\Q] = 4$, the Galois group will contain 4 elements.  Let's call the four elements $\varepsilon$, $\sigma$, $\tau$, $\sigma\tau$.  The identity automorphisms is $\varepsilon$.  We will let $\sigma(\sqrt{3}) = -\sqrt{3}$ but $\sigma(\sqrt{7}) = \sqrt{7}$.  Analogously, $\tau(\sqrt{7}) = -\sqrt{7}$ but $\tau(\sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{3}$.  This completely determines the automorphisms, as it determines the automorphisms on the basis $\{1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{7}, \sqrt{21}\}$

The Galois group is isomorphic to $\Z_2\times \Z_2$, as every element is its own inverse.
\end{solution}

\end{parts}


%\question[9] Is there a field extension $E$ of $\Q$ such that $\Gal(E:\Q)$ is not abelian?  Let's find out.
%\begin{parts}
%\part Find a cubic polynomial in $\Q[x]$ whose splitting field $E$ has degree 6 over $\Q$.  Explain how you know your polynomial works.
%
%\begin{solution}
%Let $p(x) = x^3 - 2$, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.  This polynomial has roots $\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i2\pi/3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i4\pi/3}$.  If we adjoin just the real root to $\Q$, we get a degree 3 field extension, and don't yet have all the roots of $p(x)$.  If we adjoin one of the other roots, then we will have the splitting field, but this now has degree 6 over $\Q$, as needed.
%\end{solution}
%
%
%\part Describe $\Gal(E:\Q)$.  Say explicitly what each element of the Galois group does.  What familiar group is $\Gal(E:\Q)$ isomorphic to?
%
%\begin{solution}
%The Galois group will be isomorphic to $S_3$, so lets call the elements $(1)$, $(12)$, $(13)$, $(23)$, $(123)$ and $(132)$.  Think of labeling the three roots $\sqrt[3]{2}$, $\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i2\pi/3}$ and $\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i4\pi/3}$ with $1$, $2$, and $3$ respectively, and then the permutation tells you exactly how to permute the roots.  Note that this means that $(23)$ is complex conjugation.
%
%Notice that this really has to be the Galois group - there are only three roots, but we know that the Galois group must contain 6 elements.  The only way you can get 6 different ways to permute the 3 roots is to look at all permutations of 3 elements.
%\end{solution}
%
%
%\part Find all the subgroups of $\Gal(E:\Q)$ and all the intermediate fields between $\Q$ and $E$.  Show how these ``match up.''
%
%\begin{solution}
%There are 4 non-trivial subgroups of $S_3$, namely $\{(1), (12)\}$, $\{(1), (13)\}$, $\{(1), (23)\}$, and $A_3 = \{(1), (123), (132)\}$.  The first three are easy to match up with subfields, as there are they each contain automorphisms that fix exactly one of the three roots of $p(x)$.  The first one fixes $\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i4\pi/3}$, so it corresponds to the field $\Q(\sqrt[3]{2}e^{i4\pi/3})$.  Similarly for the other two subgroups of order 2.  The last subgroup, $A_3$ is a little more mysterious.  If we look at $\Q(e^{i2\pi/3})$ we see that this is a degree 2 extension of $\Q$ ($e^{i2\pi/3}$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1$) and certainly this is a subfield of $E$.  So this must be the subfield of $E$ which matches up with $A_3$.  Notice that this suggests that the automorphisms of $A_3$ leave $e^{i2\pi/3}$ fixed.  This seems bizarre, but remember, the automorphism is not a rotation of the complex plain, as it leaves all the rationals fixed anyway.  If $(123)$ moved $e^{i2\pi/3}$ to $e^{i4\pi/3}$, then it would need to send $e^{i6\pi/3}$ to $e^{i2\pi/3}$, which is impossible since $e^{i6\pi/3}$ is just 1, which must be sent to 1. 
%\end{solution}
%\end{parts}
%
%
%\question[3] Find a degree 5 polynomial whose Galois group is isomorphic to $S_5$.  Explain how you know your example works.  Your example should be different from the one we discussed in class on Monday, April 20.  
%
%\begin{solution}
%We must find an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 with exactly two non-real roots.  This will guarantee that the Galois group contains a 5-cycle (since the polynomial is irreducible) and a 2-cycle (since complex conjugation switches just the two non-real roots), so contains all permutations in $S_5$.  
%
%Such a polynomial is $x^5 - 6x^3 - 27x - 3$, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.  That it has exactly two non-real roots can be seen by graphing, or more carefully, by considering the derivative $5x^4 - 18x^2 - 27$ which has exactly two real roots, so the original polynomial only has one maximum and one minimum.
%\end{solution}
%
%
%\bonusquestion[5000] Bonus: express the roots of the polynomial you found in the previous question in terms of rational numbers, field operations and roots (e.g., square roots, cube roots, etc.)

%\question[3] Find a degree 7 polynomial that is not solvable by radicals.\footnote{We will discuss what this means on Monday.}  Explain how you know your example works.

%\question Prove that if $p(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 3 in $F$, then the Galois group of $p(x)$ (that is, of its splitting field over $F$) is isomorphic to either $S_3$ or $\Z_3$.
