      Let <m>F</m> be a field and <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
      We already know that we can find a field extension of <m>F</m> that contains a root of <m>p(x)</m>.
      However, we would like to know whether an extension <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing all of the roots of <m>p(x)</m> exists.
      In other words,
      can we find a field extension of <m>F</m> such that <m>p(x)</m> factors into a product of linear polynomials?
      What is the <q>smallest</q> extension containing all the roots of <m>p(x)</m>?

      <proof permid="IPa">
        <p permid="Pvx">
          We will use mathematical induction on the degree of <m>p(x)</m>.
          If <m>\deg p(x) = 1</m>,
          then <m>p(x)</m> is a linear polynomial and <m>E = F</m>.
          Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials of degree <m>k</m> with
          <m>1 \leq k \lt n</m> and let <m>\deg p(x) = n</m>.
          We can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible;

      The question of uniqueness now arises for splitting fields.
      This question is answered in the affirmative.
      Given two splitting fields <m>K</m> and <m>L</m> of a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m>,
      there exists a field isomorphism
      <m>\phi : K \rightarrow L</m> that preserves <m>F</m>.
      In order to prove this result,
      we must first prove a lemma.
    </p>

    <lemma xml:id="lemma-field-isomorphism" permid="dNk">
      <statement>
        <p permid="fop">
          Let <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m> be an isomorphism of fields.
          Let <m>K</m> be an extension field of <m>E</m> and
          <m>\alpha \in K</m> be algebraic over <m>E</m> with minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>.
          Suppose that <m>L</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m> such that <m>\beta</m> is root of the polynomial in <m>F[x]</m> obtained from <m>p(x)</m> under the image of <m>\phi</m>.
          Then <m>\phi</m> extends to a unique isomorphism
          <m>\overline{\phi} : E( \alpha ) \rightarrow F( \beta )</m> such that <m>\overline{\phi}( \alpha ) = \beta</m> and
          <m>\overline{\phi}</m> agrees with <m>\phi</m> on <m>E</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="NyT">
        <p permid="vCG">
          If <m>p(x)</m> has degree <m>n</m>,
          then by <xref ref="theorem-simple_extension"/> we can write any element in
          <m>E( \alpha )</m> as a linear combination of <m>1, \alpha, \ldots, \alpha^{n - 1}</m>.
          Therefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking must be
          <me permid="EtP">
            \overline{\phi}( a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}) = \phi(a_0) + \phi(a_1) \beta + \cdots + \phi(a_{n - 1}) \beta^{n - 1}
          </me>,
          where
          <me permid="kAY">
            a_0 + a_1 \alpha + \cdots + a_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1}
          </me>
          is an element in <m>E(\alpha)</m>.
          The fact that <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is an isomorphism could be checked by direct computation;
          however, it is easier to observe that
          <m>\overline{\phi}</m> is a composition of maps that we already know to be isomorphisms.
        </p>

        <p permid="bJP">
          We can extend <m>\phi</m> to be an isomorphism from <m>E[x]</m> to <m>F[x]</m>,
          which we will also denote by <m>\phi</m>, by letting
          <me permid="QIh">
            \phi( a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n ) =  \phi( a_0 ) + \phi(a_1) x + \cdots + \phi(a_n) x^n
          </me>.
          This extension agrees with the original isomorphism <m>\phi : E \rightarrow F</m>,
          since constant polynomials get mapped to constant polynomials.
          By assumption, <m>\phi(p(x)) = q(x)</m>;
          hence, <m>\phi</m> maps <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> onto <m>\langle q(x) \rangle</m>.
          Consequently,
          we have an isomorphism <m>\psi : E[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle</m>.
          By <xref ref="proposition-minimal-poly"/>,
          we have isomorphisms <m>\sigma: E[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle \rightarrow E(\alpha)</m> and <m>\tau : F[x]/\langle q(x) \rangle \rightarrow F( \beta )</m>,
          defined by evaluation at <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>,
          respectively.
          Therefore, <m>\overline{\phi} = \tau \psi \sigma^{-1}</m> is the required isomorphism.
