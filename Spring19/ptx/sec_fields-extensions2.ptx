      A field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term>

      of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
      The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.

      We write <m>F \subset E</m>.

    <example xml:id="example-fields-q-sqrt2" permid="qbC">
      <p permid="oIb">
        For example, let
        <me permid="ibR">
          F = {\mathbb Q}( \sqrt{2}\,) = \{ a + b \sqrt{2} : a, b \in {\mathbb Q} \}

        and let <m>E =  {\mathbb Q }( \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,)</m> be the smallest field containing both
        <m>{\mathbb Q}</m> and <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m>.
        Both <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> are extension fields of the rational numbers.
        We claim that <m>E</m> is an extension field of <m>F</m>.
        To see this,
        we need only show that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is in <m>E</m>.
        Since <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> is in <m>E</m>,
        <m>1 / (\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\,) = \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m> must also be in <m>E</m>.
        Taking linear combinations of
        <m>\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}</m> and <m>\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}</m>,
        we find that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and
        <m>\sqrt{3}</m> must both be in <m>E</m>.

    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f4" permid="WiL">
      <p permid="UPk">
        Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
        Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
        we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        We will construct a field extension of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        By <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>,
        the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
        hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
        Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
        By the division algorithm,
        <me permid="Oja">
          f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
        </me>,
        where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me permid="uqj">
          f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
        </me>.
        The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
        <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
        Consequently,
        <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
        The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
        <md permid="GEB">
          <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
          <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
        </md>.
        Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
        hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
        <me permid="axs">
          (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha

        Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
        We summarize these computations in the following tables,
        which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

      The following theorem, due to Kronecker,
      is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory" permid="lrJ">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ldB">
          Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
          Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an element
          <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="fCx">
        <p permid="wHZ">
          To prove this theorem,
          we will employ the method that we used to construct <xref ref="example-fields-finite-f4"/>.
          Clearly, we can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial.
          We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>;
          hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
        </p>

        <p permid="cPi">
          We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
          We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
          where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
          It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
          Observe that
          <me permid="zac">
            \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
          </me>
          and
          <me permid="fhl">
            \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
          </me>.
          To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
          <me permid="Lou">
            a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
          </me>.
          Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
          since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
          the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
          Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
          Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
          we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
          <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
        </p>
          <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
        <p permid="IWr">
          It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
          Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
          <md permid="rvD">
            <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
          </md>.
          Therefore, we have found an element
          <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.

          Let <m>\phi_{\alpha} : F[x] \rightarrow E</m> be the evaluation homomorphism.
          The kernel of <m>\phi_{\alpha}</m> is a principal ideal generated by some

        It is easy to determine that <m>\{ 1, \sqrt{5}i\, \}</m> is a basis for

        Notice that <m>\sqrt[6]{5}\, i</m> is a zero of <m>x^6 + 5</m>.
        We can show that this polynomial is irreducible over

        Consequently,
