  <introduction permid="VBe">

      Most people are fairly familiar with polynomials by the time they begin to study abstract algebra.
      When we examine polynomial expressions such as
      <md permid="Lcm">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = x^3 -3x +2</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = 3x^2 -6x +5</mrow>
      </md>,
      we have a pretty good idea of what
      <m>p(x) + q(x)</m> and <m>p(x) q(x)</m> mean.
      We just add and multiply polynomials as functions; that is,
      <md permid="rjv">
        <mrow>(p +q)(x) &amp; = p(x) + q(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; =  ( x^3 - 3 x + 2 ) + ( 3 x^2 - 6 x + 5 )</mrow>
        <mrow>&amp; = x^3 + 3 x^2 - 9 x + 7</mrow>
      </md>
      and

        <mrow>&amp; = 3 x^5 - 6 x^4 - 4 x^3 + 24 x^2 - 27 x + 10</mrow>
      </md>.
      It is probably no surprise that polynomials form a ring.
      In this chapter we shall emphasize the algebraic structure of polynomials by studying polynomial rings.
      We can prove many results for polynomial rings that are similar to the theorems we proved for the integers.
      Analogs of prime numbers,
      the division algorithm, and the Euclidean algorithm exist for polynomials.

      We will denote the set of all polynomials with coefficients in a ring <m>R</m> by <m>R[x]</m>.

      <notation>
        <usage>R[x]</usage>
        <description>ring of polynomials over a ring <m>R</m></description>
      </notation>

      Two polynomials are equal exactly when their corresponding coefficients are equal; that is,
      if we let
      <md permid="PMf">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>

      then <m>p(x) = q(x)</m> if and only if
      <m>a_i = b_i</m> for all <m>i \geq 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ueb">
      To show that the set of all polynomials forms a ring,
      we must first define addition and multiplication.
      We define the sum of two polynomials as follows.
      Let
      <md permid="ooP">
        <mrow>p(x) &amp; = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</mrow>
        <mrow>q(x) &amp; = b_0 + b_1 x + \cdots + b_m x^m</mrow>
      </md>.
      Then the sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is
      <me permid="vTo">
        p(x) + q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_k x^k
      </me>,
      where <m>c_i = a_i + b_i</m> for each <m>i</m>.
      We define the product of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> to be
      <me permid="cax">
        p(x) q(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + \cdots + c_{m + n} x^{m + n}
      </me>,
      where
      <me permid="IhG">
        c_i = \sum_{k = 0}^i a_k b_{i - k} = a_0  b_i + a_1 b_{i -1} + \cdots + a_{i -1} b _1 + a_i b_0
      </me>
      for each <m>i</m>.
      Notice that in each case some of the coefficients may be zero.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-poly-operations" permid="YvK">
      <p permid="hBo">
        Suppose that
        <me permid="UvY">
          p(x) = 3 + 0 x + 0 x^2 + 2 x^3 + 0 x^4

        </me>
        are polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}[x]</m>.
        If the coefficient of some term in a polynomial is zero,
        then we usually just omit that term.
        In this case we  would write
        <m>p(x) =  3 + 2 x^3</m> and <m>q(x) = 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The sum of these two polynomials is
        <me permid="gKq">
          p(x) + q(x)= 5 - x^2 + 2 x^3 + 4 x^4
        </me>.
        The product,
        <me permid="MRz">
          p(x) q(x) = (3 + 2 x^3)( 2 - x^2 + 4 x^4 ) =  6 - 3x^2 + 4 x^3 + 12 x^4  - 2 x^5 + 8 x^7
        </me>,
        can be calculated either by determining the <m>c_i</m>s in the definition or by simply multiplying polynomials in the same way as we have always done.

    </example>

    <example xml:id="example-poly-integral-domains" permid="ECT">
      <p permid="NIx">
        Let

        be polynomials in <m>{\mathbb Z}_{12}[x]</m>.
        The sum of <m>p(x)</m> and <m>q(x)</m> is <m>7 + 4 x^2 + 3 x^3 + 4 x^4</m>.
        The product of the two polynomials is  the zero polynomial.
        This example tells us that we can not expect <m>R[x]</m> to be an integral domain if <m>R</m> is not an integral domain.

          Our first task is to show that <m>R[x]</m> is an abelian group under polynomial addition.
          The zero polynomial, <m>f(x) = 0</m>, is the additive identity.
          Given a polynomial <m>p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>,
          the inverse of <m>p(x)</m> is easily verified to be <m>-p(x) = \sum_{i = 0}^{n} (-a_i) x^i = -\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_i x^i</m>.
          Commutativity and associativity follow immediately from the definition of polynomial addition and from the fact that addition in <m>R</m> is both commutative and associative.

          and <m>d(x)</m> and <m>d'(x)</m> are both greatest common divisors,
          <m>\deg d(x) = \deg d'(x)</m>.
          Since <m>d(x)</m> and <m>d'(x)</m> are both monic polynomials of the same degree,
          it must be the case that <m>d(x) = d'(x)</m>.
