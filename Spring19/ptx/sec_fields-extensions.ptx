  <title>Extension Fields</title>
  <introduction permid="ngW">
    <p permid="WEx">
      Recall that we say a field <m>E</m> is an <term>extension field</term>
          <idx><h>Extension</h><h>field</h></idx>
          <idx><h>Field</h><h>extension</h></idx>
      of a field <m>F</m> if <m>F</m> is a subfield of <m>E</m>.
      The field <m>F</m> is called the <term>base field</term>.
          <idx><h>Field</h><h>base</h></idx>
      We write <m>F \subset E</m>.  Or goal is to build extension fields so that particular polynomials that were previously irreducible can now be factored in the extension field.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      One obvious way to ensure this happens is to include the root of that polynomial in the field.  We previously defined <m>E = \Q(\sqrt{2}) = \{a + b\sqrt{2} \st a, b \in \Q</m> as an extension field of <m>\Q</m>.  In this field, the polynomial <m>x^2 - 2</m> has a root, so can be factored.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In general, given a polynomial <m>p(x) \in F[x]</m> for some field <m>F</m>, and a root <m>\alpha</m>, we want to build an extension field containing <m>\alpha</m> so that <m>p(x)</m> factors.  We could do the same thing as above, taking <m>F(\alpha)</m>.  That is, add a new element <m>\alpha</m> to <m>F</m> and close the set under addition and multiplication.  The question is, will this always be a field?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our salvation comes from quotient rings.  If it has been a while, you might review <xref ref="section-ring-homomorphisms"/>.  Then try the following activity, which works through the general strategy in the simple example of <m>\alpha = \sqrt{2}</m>.

    <title>Extension Fields and Polynomials</title>
    
    
    
    <p>
      We will often take <m>F = \Q</m>, but of course other fields can be used as well and our strategy of using quotient rings will still work.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="example-fields-finite-f4" permid="WiL">
      <p permid="UPk">
        Let <m>p(x) = x^2 + x + 1 \in {\mathbb Z}_2[x]</m>.
        Since neither 0 nor 1 is a root of this polynomial,
        we know that <m>p(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>.
        We will construct a field extension of
        <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        By <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>,
        the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is maximal;
        hence, <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
        (That modding out by a maximal ideal produces a fields is a result that applies to rings in general, not just polynomial rings; we could have argued that <m>\Z_2[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle</m> is a field using Bezout's identity as well.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <m>f(x) + \langle p(x) \rangle</m> be an arbitrary element of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
        By the division algorithm,
        <me permid="Oja">
          f(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) q(x) + r(x)
        </me>,
        where the degree of <m>r(x)</m> is less than the degree of <m>x^2 + x + 1</m>.
        Therefore,
        <me permid="uqj">
          f(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle = r(x) + \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle
        </me>.
        The only possibilities for <m>r(x)</m> are then <m>0</m>,
        <m>1</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>1 + x</m>.
        Consequently,
        <m>E = {\mathbb Z}_2[x] / \langle x^2 + x + 1 \rangle</m> is a field with four elements and must be a field extension of <m>{\mathbb Z}_2</m>,
        containing a zero <m>\alpha</m> of <m>p(x)</m>.
        The field <m>{\mathbb Z}_2(  \alpha)</m> consists of elements
        <md permid="GEB">
          <mrow>0 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 0</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 0 \alpha &amp; = 1</mrow>
          <mrow>0 + 1 \alpha &amp; = \alpha</mrow>
          <mrow>1 + 1 \alpha &amp; = 1 + \alpha</mrow>
        </md>.
        Notice that <m>{\alpha}^2 + {\alpha} + 1 = 0</m>;
        hence, if we compute <m>(1 + \alpha)^2</m>,
        <me permid="axs">
          (1 + \alpha)(1 + \alpha)= 1 + \alpha + \alpha + (\alpha)^2 = \alpha
        </me>.
        Other calculations are accomplished in a similar manner.
        We summarize these computations in the following tables,
        which tell us how to add and multiply elements in <m>E</m>.

    <p>
      To summarize our strategy: we want to build an extension field of <m>F</m> that contains an element <m>\alpha</m>, presumably not already in <m>F</m>.  As long as <m>\alpha</m> is the root of a polynomial, we can take <m>p(x)</m> to be an irreducible polynomial (over <m>F</m>) that has <m>\alpha</m> as a root, and consider the quotient ring <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  Using the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem, this quotient ring will be isomorphic to our desired extension field.
    </p>

    <p permid="OZY">
      That is precisely the content of the statement and proof of the following theorem, due to Kronecker.
      The result is so important and so basic to our understanding of fields that it is often known as the <em>Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory</em>.
    </p>

    <theorem xml:id="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory" permid="lrJ">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ldB">
          Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>p(x)</m> be a nonconstant polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>.
          Then there exists an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> and an element
          <m>\alpha \in E</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof permid="fCx">
        <p permid="wHZ">
          We can assume that <m>p(x)</m> is an irreducible polynomial (otherwise, just factor it and work with an irreducible part that has <m>\alpha</m> as a root).
          We wish to find an extension field <m>E</m> of <m>F</m> containing an element <m>\alpha</m> such that <m>p(\alpha) = 0</m>.
          The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> generated by <m>p(x)</m> is a maximal ideal in <m>F[x]</m> by <xref ref="theorem-max-ideal-poly"/>;
          hence, <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is a field.
          We claim that <m>E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> is the desired field.
        </p>

        <p permid="cPi">
          We first show that <m>E</m> is a field extension of <m>F</m>.
          We can define a homomorphism of commutative rings by the map <m>\psi:F \rightarrow F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>,
          where <m>\psi(a) = a + \langle p(x)\rangle</m> for <m>a \in F</m>.
          It is easy to check that <m>\psi</m> is indeed a ring homomorphism.
          Observe that
          <me permid="zac">
            \psi( a ) + \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle) + (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = (a + b) + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( a + b )
          </me>
          and
          <me permid="fhl">
            \psi( a ) \psi( b ) = (a + \langle p(x) \rangle)  (b + \langle p(x) \rangle) = ab + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi( ab )
          </me>.
          To prove that <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one, assume that
          <me permid="Lou">
            a + \langle p(x) \rangle = \psi(a) = \psi(b) = b + \langle p(x) \rangle
          </me>.
          Then <m>a - b</m> is a multiple of <m>p(x)</m>,
          since it lives in the ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Since <m>p(x)</m> is a nonconstant polynomial,
          the only possibility is that <m>a - b = 0</m>.
          Consequently, <m>a = b</m> and <m>\psi</m> is injective.
          Since <m>\psi</m> is one-to-one,
          we can identify <m>F</m> with the subfield
          <m>\{ a + \langle p(x) \rangle : a \in F \}</m> of <m>E</m> and view <m>E</m> as an extension field of <m>F</m>.
        </p>
          <!-- \alpha is in E not F - TWJ 4/23/2011 -->
        <p permid="IWr">
          It remains for us to prove that <m>p(x)</m> has a zero <m>\alpha \in E</m>.
          Set <m>\alpha = x + \langle p(x) \rangle</m>.
          Then <m>\alpha</m> is in <m>E</m>.
          If <m>p(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n</m>, then
          <md permid="rvD">
            <mrow>p( \alpha ) &amp; =  a_0 + a_1( x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + a_n ( x + \langle p(x) \rangle)^n</mrow>
            <mrow>&amp; = a_0 + ( a_1 x + \langle p(x) \rangle) + \cdots + (a_n  x^n + \langle p(x) \rangle)</mrow>

            <mrow>&amp; = 0 + \langle p(x) \rangle</mrow>
          </md>.
          Therefore, we have found an element
          <m>\alpha \in E = F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m> such that <m>\alpha</m> is a zero of <m>p(x)</m>.

      There are lots of extension fields that contain elements transcendental over the base field.  For example, we could consider <m>\Q(\pi)</m>. It turns out this will be isomorphic to <m>\Q(x)</m>, the field of all rational functions with rational coefficients.  So in some sense, this is not that interesting: no matter what transcendental element you add, you get the same extension field.  We have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic extensions.

          The ideal <m>\langle p(x) \rangle</m> consists exactly of those elements of <m>F[x]</m> having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
          If <m>f( \alpha ) = 0</m> and <m>f(x)</m> is not the zero polynomial,
          then <m>f(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle</m> and <m>p(x)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.
          So <m>p(x)</m> is a polynomial of minimal degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero.
          Any other polynomial of the same degree having <m>\alpha</m> as a zero must have the form
          <m>\beta p( x)</m> for some <m>\beta \in F</m>.

      At this point, it might seem like we are running around in circles, as it often seems whenever we get close to the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem.  Before moving on, let's try to sort out the different things the theorems and propositions are doing in this section.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First, if we are start with a given polynomial <m>p(x)</m> over some field <m>F</m>, we know there is some extension field <m>E</m> above <m>F</m> in which <m>p(x)</m> has a root <m>\alpha</m> (and therefore factors).  This is <xref ref="theorem-fundamental-of-field-theory"/>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On the other hand, we can start a extension field <m>E</m> of a base field <m>F</m> that contains some element <m>\alpha</m> <em>algebraic</em> over <m>F</m>.  By definition, <m>\alpha</m> is the root to some polynomial with coefficients from <m>F</m>, and by <xref ref="thm_minimum-poly"/> there is a minimum polynomial <m>p(x)</m> for <m>\alpha</m>.  By <xref ref="proposition-minimal-poly"/>, the field extension <m>F(\alpha)</m> (which is a subfield of <m>E</m>, if not <m>E</m> exactly) is isomorphic to the quotient ring <m>F[x]/\langle p(x) \rangle</m>.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      So if you have a minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m>, you can find an extension field that contains a root <m>\alpha</m>, namely <m>F[x]/\langle p(x)\rangle</m>.  Or if you have an extension field with a root <m>\alpha</m>, you can find a minimal polynomial <m>p(x)</m> and the extension field that you would get by starting with <m>p(x)</m> will be precisely the smallest field containing <m>F</m> and <m>\alpha</m>.
