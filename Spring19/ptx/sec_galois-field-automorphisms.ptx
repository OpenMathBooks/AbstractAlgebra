        <p permid="sqb">
          Our first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining automorphisms of fields.

              The set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is a group under composition of functions.

          <proof permid="ISA">
            <p permid="vGg">
              If <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> are automorphisms of <m>F</m>,
              then so are <m>\sigma \tau</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}</m>.
              The identity is certainly an automorphism;
              hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field <m>F</m> is indeed a group.

              Let <m>E</m> be a field extension of <m>F</m>.
              Then the set of all automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a group;
              that is, the set of all automorphisms <m>\sigma : E \rightarrow E</m> such that

            <p permid="bNp">
              We need only show that the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that fix <m>F</m> elementwise is a subgroup of the group of all automorphisms of <m>E</m>.
              Let <m>\sigma</m> and <m>\tau</m> be two automorphisms of <m>E</m> such that <m>\sigma( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> and
              <m>\tau( \alpha ) = \alpha</m> for all <m>\alpha \in F</m>.
              Then <m>\sigma \tau( \alpha ) = \sigma( \alpha) = \alpha</m> and <m>\sigma^{-1}( \alpha ) = \alpha</m>.
              Since the identity fixes every element of <m>E</m>,
              the set of automorphisms of <m>E</m> that leave elements of <m>F</m> fixed is a subgroup of the entire group of automorphisms of <m>E</m>.

            Let us compute the Galois group of
            <me permid="xYj">
              f(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
            </me>
            over <m>{\mathbb Q}</m>.
            First let's check that <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible over <m>\Q</m>.  To do this, consider a new polynomial <m>g(x) = f(x+1)</m> (essentially doing a change of variables).  We have 
            <me>
              g(x) = x^4 + 5x^3 + 10x^2 + 10x + 5.
            </me>
            This is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.  But if <m>f(x)</m> factored, then so would <m>g(x)</m>, so we see that <m>f(x)</m> is irreducible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, since <m>(x -1)f(x) = x^5 - 1</m>,
            we can use DeMoivre's Theorem to determine that the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>\omega^i</m>,
            where  <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m> and
            <me permid="efs">
              \omega = \cos(2 \pi / 5 ) + i \sin(2 \pi / 5 )
            </me>.
            Hence, the splitting field of <m>f(x)</m> must be <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega)</m>.
            We can define automorphisms
            <m>\sigma_i</m> of <m>{\mathbb Q}(\omega )</m> by
            <m>\sigma_i( \omega ) = \omega^i</m> for <m>i = 1, \ldots, 4</m>.
            It is easy to check that these are indeed distinct automorphisms in <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>.
            Since
            <me permid="KmB">
              [{\mathbb Q}( \omega) : {\mathbb Q}] = | G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})| = 4
            </me>,
            the <m>\sigma_i</m>'s must be all of <m>G( {\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q} )</m>.
            Therefore, <m>G({\mathbb Q}( \omega) / {\mathbb Q})\cong {\mathbb Z}_4</m> since <m>\omega</m> is a generator for the Galois group.

            <p permid="MEr">
              Suppose that <m>E</m> is a finite extension of an infinite field (it turns out that there is no problem if <m>F</m> is a finite field, although we will not consider this case now anyway).
              We will prove the result for <m>F(\alpha, \beta)</m>.
              The general case easily follows when we use mathematical induction.
              Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be  the minimal polynomials of <m>\alpha</m> and <m>\beta</m>,
              respectively.
              Let <m>K</m> be the field in which both <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> split.
              Suppose that <m>f(x)</m> has zeros
              <m>\alpha = \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n</m> in <m>K</m> and <m>g(x)</m> has zeros <m>\beta = \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_m</m> in <m>K</m>.
              All of these zeros have multiplicity <m>1</m>,
              since <m>E</m> is separable over <m>F</m>.
              Since <m>F</m> is infinite, we can find an <m>a</m> in <m>F</m> such that
              <me permid="iPl">

              Therefore, <m>a( \beta - \beta_j ) \neq \alpha_i - \alpha</m>.
              Let <m>\gamma = \alpha + a \beta</m>.
              Then
              <me permid="OWu">
                \gamma = \alpha + a \beta \neq \alpha_i + a \beta_j;
              </me>
              hence, <m>\gamma - a \beta_j \neq \alpha_i</m> for all
              <m>i,
              j</m> with <m>j \neq 1</m>.
              Define <m>h(x) \in F( \gamma )[x]</m> by <m>h(x) = f( \gamma - ax)</m>.
              Then <m>h( \beta ) = f( \alpha ) = 0</m>.
              However, <m>h( \beta_j ) \neq 0</m> for <m>j \neq 1</m>.
              Hence, <m>h(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> have a single common factor in <m>F( \gamma )[x]</m>;
              that is, the minimal polynomial of <m>\beta</m> over <m>F( \gamma )</m> must be linear,
              since <m>\beta</m> is the only zero common to both <m>g(x)</m> and <m>h(x)</m>.
              So <m>\beta \in F( \gamma )</m> and
              <m>\alpha = \gamma - a \beta</m> is in <m>F( \gamma )</m>.
