          The main goal in group theory is to classify all groups;
          however, it makes sense to consider two groups to be the same if they are isomorphic.
          Hence, we can modify our goal of classifying all groups to classifying all groups
          <term>up to isomorphism</term>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For example, you might wonder how many different cyclic groups there are of a given order.  It turns out the answer is 1.  For any given order, there is exactly one cyclic group (up to isomorphism) of that order: <m>\Z_n</m> is isomorphic to every cyclic group of order <m>n</m>.  Later will will give a similar classification of all abelian groups of a particular type.

        <p>
          The other advantage in considering isomorphisms is that it provides us a way to represent groups in some consistent way.  Let's see what this means.

        <title>Cayley's Theorem</title>
        <p permid="rLL">
          Cayley proved that if <m>G</m> is a group,
          it is isomorphic to a group of permutations on some set;
          hence, every group is a permutation group.
          Cayley's Theorem is what we call a representation theorem.
          The aim of representation theory is to find an isomorphism of some group <m>G</m> that we wish to study into a group that we know a great deal about,
          such as a group of permutations or matrices.

              Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

          </statement>

          <proof permid="BPe">
            <p permid="sCJ">
              Let <m>G</m> be a group.
              We must find a group of permutations
              <m>\overline{G}</m> that is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.
              For any <m>g \in G</m>, define a  function
              <m>\lambda_g : G \rightarrow G</m> by <m>\lambda_g(a) = ga</m>.
              We claim that <m>\lambda_g</m> is a permutation of <m>G</m>.
              To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is one-to-one,
              suppose that <m>\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b)</m>.
              Then
              <me permid="ukS">
                ga =\lambda_g(a) = \lambda_g(b) = gb
              </me>.
              Hence, <m>a = b</m>.
              To show that <m>\lambda_g</m> is onto,
              we must prove that for each <m>a \in G</m>,
              there is a <m>b</m> such that <m>\lambda_g (b) = a</m>.
              Let <m>b = g^{-1} a</m>.
            </p>

            <p permid="YJS">
              Now we are ready to define our group <m>\overline{G}</m>.
              Let
              <me permid="asb">
                \overline{G} = \{ \lambda_g : g \in G \}
              </me>.
              We must show that <m>\overline{G}</m> is a group under composition of functions and find an isomorphism between <m>G</m> and <m>\overline{G}</m>.
              We have closure under composition of functions since
              <me permid="Gzk">
                (\lambda_g \circ \lambda_h )(a) = \lambda_g(ha) = gha = \lambda_{gh} (a)
              </me>.
              Also,
              <me permid="mGt">
                \lambda_e (a) = ea = a
              </me>

              <me permid="SNC">
                (\lambda_{g^{-1}} \circ \lambda_g) (a) = \lambda_{g^{-1}} (ga) = g^{-1} g a = a = \lambda_e (a)

            </p>

            <p permid="ERb">
              We can define an isomorphism from <m>G</m> to
              <m>\overline{G}</m> by <m>\phi : g \mapsto \lambda_g</m>.
              The group operation is preserved since
              <me permid="yUL">
                \phi(gh) = \lambda_{gh} = \lambda_g \lambda_h = \phi(g) \phi(h)
              </me>.
              It is also one-to-one, because if <m>\phi(g)(a) = \phi(h)(a)</m>, then
              <me permid="fbU">
                ga = \lambda_g a = \lambda_h a=  ha
              </me>.
              Hence, <m>g = h</m>.
              That <m>\phi</m> is onto follows from the fact that
              <m>\phi( g ) = \lambda_g</m> for any <m>\lambda_g \in \overline{G}</m>.

          Arthur Cayley
              <idx><h>Cayley, Arthur</h></idx>
          was born in England in 1821,element-wise
          though he spent much of the first part of his life in Russia,
          where his father was a merchant.
          Cayley was educated at Cambridge,
          where he took the first Smith's Prize in mathematics.
          A lawyer for much of his adult life,
          he wrote several papers in his early twenties before entering the legal profession at the age of 25.
          While practicing law he continued his mathematical research,
          writing more than 300 papers during this period of his life.
          These included some of his best work.
          In 1863 he left law to become a professor at Cambridge.
          Cayley wrote more than 900 papers in fields such as group theory,
          geometry, and linear algebra.
          His legal knowledge was very valuable to Cambridge;
          he participated in the writing of many of the university's statutes.
          Cayley was also one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.
